## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- local-dev lives in mesh monorepo as packages/local-dev/ (not in mcps/ companion repo)
- plugin-deco-blocks is separate from site-editor so other tools can consume it too
- site-editor checks connection capabilities at runtime — does not directly depend on local-dev package
- Dev server management (spawn + SSE log stream) is in scope for Phase 15 v1 (confirmed by user)
- Zero-config auto-opens browser on first run (best DX)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- packages/mcp-local-object-storage/ must be deleted when Phase 15 lands (redundant)
- Phase 17 is a clean re-implementation from gui/site-builder — the branch has reference material but Phase 17 must be independently mergeable from main
- Phase 18 depends on both Phase 15 (local-dev) and Phase 17 (site-editor) being merged first
