# Repository Guidelines

This file provides guidance when working with code in this repository, including for Claude Code (claude.ai/code) and other AI coding assistants.

## Overview

MCP Mesh is an open-source control plane for Model Context Protocol (MCP) traffic. It provides a unified layer for authentication, routing, and observability between MCP clients (Cursor, Claude, VS Code) and MCP servers. The system is built as a monorepo using Bun workspaces with TypeScript, Hono (API), and React 19 (UI).

## Commands

### Development
```bash
# Start full dev environment (migrations + client + server)
bun run dev

# Start mesh client only (Vite dev server on port 4000)
bun run --cwd=apps/mesh dev:client

# Start mesh server only (Hono with hot reload)
bun run --cwd=apps/mesh dev:server

# Run documentation site locally
bun run docs:dev
```

### Testing & Quality
```bash
# Run all tests (Bun test runner)
bun test

# Run tests for specific file/pattern
bun test path/to/file.test.ts

# TypeScript type checking (all workspaces)
bun run check

# Lint with oxlint and custom plugins
bun run lint

# Format code with Biome (ALWAYS run before committing)
bun run fmt

# Check formatting without modifying
bun run fmt:check
```

**IMPORTANT**: Always run `bun run fmt` after making code changes to ensure consistent formatting. A lefthook pre-commit hook is configured to run this automatically. Install with `npx lefthook install`.

### Database
```bash
# Run Kysely migrations (from apps/mesh/)
bun run --cwd=apps/mesh migrate

# Run Better Auth schema migrations
bun run --cwd=apps/mesh better-auth:migrate
```

### Build & Deploy
```bash
# Build runtime package
bun run build:runtime

# Build mesh client (production)
bun run --cwd=apps/mesh build:client

# Build mesh server (bundle for deployment)
bun run --cwd=apps/mesh build:server

# Run production build
bun run --cwd=apps/mesh start
```

## Architecture

### Core Abstractions

**MeshContext** (`apps/mesh/src/core/mesh-context.ts`)
The central runtime interface injected into all tools. Provides:
- `auth`: Authentication state (user, session, organization)
- `access`: Access control layer (RBAC checks)
- `storage`: Database operations (Kysely-based)
- `vault`: Credential vault for secure token storage
- `tracer`: OpenTelemetry distributed tracing
- `meter`: OpenTelemetry metrics collection

Tools NEVER access HTTP objects, database drivers, or environment variables directly—all dependencies flow through MeshContext.

**defineTool()** (`apps/mesh/src/core/define-tool.ts`)
Declarative API for creating type-safe, auditable MCP tools. Automatically provides:
- Input/output validation (Zod schemas)
- Authorization checking (`ctx.access.check()`)
- Audit logging
- OpenTelemetry tracing and metrics
- Structured error handling

Example tool structure:
```typescript
export const EXAMPLE_TOOL = defineTool({
  name: "EXAMPLE_TOOL",
  description: "...",
  inputSchema: z.object({ ... }),
  outputSchema: z.object({ ... }),
  handler: async (input, ctx) => {
    await ctx.access.check(); // Authorization
    const result = await ctx.storage.someTable.create(...);
    return result;
  },
});
```

### Project Structure & Module Organization

The workspace is managed via Bun workspaces. The main application lives in `apps/mesh/` and contains the full-stack MCP Mesh implementation (Hono API server + Vite/React client). Documentation site lives in `apps/docs/` (Astro-based).

**apps/mesh/** - Main full-stack application
- `src/api/` - Hono HTTP routes + MCP proxy routes
- `src/auth/` - Better Auth (OAuth 2.1 + SSO + API keys)
- `src/core/` - MeshContext, AccessControl, defineTool
- `src/tools/` - Built-in MCP management tools (organized by domain)
- `src/storage/` - Kysely database adapters and operations
- `src/event-bus/` - Pub/sub event delivery system (CloudEvents v1.0)
- `src/encryption/` - Token vault & credential management
- `src/observability/` - OpenTelemetry tracing & metrics
- `src/web/` - React 19 admin UI (Vite + TanStack Router)
- `migrations/` - Kysely database migrations

**packages/** - Shared logic
- `packages/bindings/` - Core MCP bindings and connection abstractions (defines standardized interfaces)
- `packages/runtime/` - Runtime utilities for MCP proxy, OAuth, and tools
- `packages/ui/` - Shared React components (shadcn-based design system)
- `packages/cli/` - CLI tooling (deco commands)
- `packages/vite-plugin-deco/` - Vite plugin for Deco projects
- `packages/create-deco/` - Project scaffolding tool (npm init)

Database migrations live in `apps/mesh/migrations/`, code quality plugins in `plugins/`, and infrastructure/deploy configs in `deploy/`.

### Key Architectural Patterns

**Virtual MCPs** (`apps/mesh/src/tools/virtual/`)
Runtime strategies modeled as Virtual MCPs—different ways of exposing tools through one endpoint:
- Full-context: expose all tools (simple, deterministic)
- Smart selection: narrow toolset before execution
- Code execution: load tools on demand in sandbox

Virtual MCPs are configurable and extensible.

**Bindings System** (`packages/bindings/`)
Standardized interfaces that MCPs can implement (similar to TypeScript interfaces but with runtime validation):
- Define contracts with Zod schemas
- Tools check if connections implement specific bindings
- Well-known bindings: collections (CRUD), models (AI providers), event bus, event subscriber
- Uses `createBindingChecker()` for runtime verification

**Event Bus** (`apps/mesh/src/event-bus/`)
Pub/sub system between connections following CloudEvents v1.0 spec:
- At-least-once delivery with exponential backoff (1s to 1hr, max 20 attempts)
- Scheduled delivery (`deliverAt`) and recurring events (`cron`)
- Per-event results (subscribers can return individual results per event)
- Pluggable NotifyStrategy: PollingStrategy (timer-based) or PostgresNotifyStrategy (LISTEN/NOTIFY)

#### Event Bus Files
- `packages/bindings/src/well-known/event-bus.ts` - EVENT_BUS_BINDING (PUBLISH, SUBSCRIBE, UNSUBSCRIBE, CANCEL, ACK)
- `packages/bindings/src/well-known/event-subscriber.ts` - EVENT_SUBSCRIBER_BINDING (ON_EVENTS)
- `apps/mesh/src/event-bus/` - EventBus implementation and worker
- `apps/mesh/src/event-bus/polling.ts` - Timer-based NotifyStrategy (for SQLite/other)
- `apps/mesh/src/event-bus/postgres-notify.ts` - LISTEN/NOTIFY NotifyStrategy (for PostgreSQL)
- `apps/mesh/src/storage/event-bus.ts` - Database operations
- `apps/mesh/src/tools/eventbus/` - MCP tools (publish, subscribe, unsubscribe, list, cancel, ack)
- `apps/mesh/migrations/008-event-bus.ts` - Database schema

#### Event Bus MCP Tools
- `EVENT_PUBLISH` - Publish events (supports `deliverAt` for scheduled, `cron` for recurring)
- `EVENT_SUBSCRIBE` - Subscribe to event types
- `EVENT_UNSUBSCRIBE` - Remove subscriptions
- `EVENT_SUBSCRIPTION_LIST` - List subscriptions
- `EVENT_CANCEL` - Cancel a recurring cron event (only publisher can cancel)
- `EVENT_ACK` - Acknowledge event delivery (used with `retryAfter` flow)

#### Event Bus Bindings
- `EVENT_BUS_BINDING` - For connections using the event bus (PUBLISH, SUBSCRIBE, UNSUBSCRIBE, CANCEL, ACK)
- `EVENT_SUBSCRIBER_BINDING` - For connections receiving events (implements `ON_EVENTS`)

#### ON_EVENTS Response
Subscribers can return batch or per-event results:
```typescript
// Batch mode
{ success: true }

// Per-event mode
{
  results: {
    "event-1": { success: true },
    "event-2": { success: false, error: "Validation failed" },
    "event-3": { retryAfter: 60000 }  // Retry in 1 minute, use EVENT_ACK to confirm
  }
}
```

#### NotifyStrategy Architecture
The worker doesn't poll internally - it relies on a NotifyStrategy to trigger processing:
- `PollingStrategy(intervalMs)` - Timer-based, for SQLite or databases without pub/sub
- `PostgresNotifyStrategy(pool)` - Event-based via LISTEN/NOTIFY, no polling

#### Event Bus Configuration (EventBusConfig)
```typescript
{
  pollIntervalMs: 5000,    // Poll interval for PollingStrategy (default 5s)
  batchSize: 100,          // Max events per batch
  maxAttempts: 20,         // Delivery attempts before failure
  retryDelayMs: 1000,      // Base delay (1s)
  maxDelayMs: 3600000,     // Max delay cap (1hr)
}
```

### Database & Storage

Uses **Kysely ORM** with support for SQLite (default via `kysely-bun-worker`) and PostgreSQL.
- Database URL: `DATABASE_URL` environment variable (defaults to `file:./data/mesh.db`)
- Schema types: `apps/mesh/src/storage/types.ts`
- Operations organized by domain: `apps/mesh/src/storage/`
- Multi-tenancy: Workspace/project isolation for config, credentials, policies, audit logs
- Migrations use Kysely's migration system combined with Better Auth migrations

Database schema key concepts:
- Organizations managed by Better Auth organization plugin
- Connections are organization-scoped (workspace or project level)
- Permissions follow Better Auth format: `{ [resource]: [actions...] }`

### Authentication & Authorization

**Better Auth** for authentication:
- OAuth 2.1, SSO, API keys
- Config: `apps/mesh/auth-config.json` (example: `auth-config.example.json`)

**AccessControl** (`apps/mesh/src/core/access-control.ts`) for authorization:
- Organization/project-level RBAC
- Fine-grained permissions per workspace/project
- Connection-specific permissions (e.g., `{ "conn_<UUID>": ["SEND_MESSAGE"] }`)

### Observability

**OpenTelemetry** (`apps/mesh/src/observability/`)
- Full tracing for tools, workflows, and UI interactions
- Metrics collection (Prometheus exporter)
- Logging with OTLP exporter
- Every tool call automatically traced

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

### Style & Formatting
- **Biome** enforces two-space indentation and double quotes
- **ALWAYS** run `bun run fmt` after making code changes (pre-commit hook via lefthook)
- Components and classes: PascalCase
- Hooks and utilities: camelCase
- Files in shared packages: kebab-case (enforced by `plugins/enforce-kebab-case-file-names.ts`)

### React 19 Patterns
- Uses React 19 with React Compiler (babel-plugin-react-compiler)
- **DO NOT** use `useEffect` (banned by `plugins/ban-use-effect.ts`)—prefer alternatives
- **DO NOT** use `useMemo`/`useCallback`/`memo` (banned by `plugins/ban-memoization.ts`)—React 19 compiler handles optimization
- Tailwind v4 design system with tokens enforced by `plugins/ensure-tailwind-design-system-tokens.ts`

### Custom Oxlint Plugins
Located in `plugins/`:
- `enforce-kebab-case-file-names.ts` - kebab-case for shared package files
- `enforce-query-key-constants.ts` - query keys must use constants
- `ban-use-effect.ts` - ban useEffect
- `ban-memoization.ts` - ban useMemo/useCallback/memo
- `ensure-tailwind-design-system-tokens.ts` - enforce Tailwind consistency

### TypeScript
- Favor explicit types over `any`
- Use Zod for runtime validation and schema definitions
- TypeScript 5.9+ with strict mode enabled

## Testing Guidelines

- **Bun test runner** for all tests
- Co-locate test files: `*.test.ts` or `*.test.tsx` next to source
- Run `bun test` before submitting PRs
- Add integration tests for API endpoints and database operations
- Test files use Bun's built-in test framework
- Document any intentional coverage gaps in PR descriptions

## Working with Tools

When creating new MCP tools:
1. Use `defineTool()` from `apps/mesh/src/core/define-tool.ts`
2. Place tools in appropriate domain folder under `apps/mesh/src/tools/`
3. Always inject `MeshContext` as second parameter
4. Call `await ctx.access.check()` for authorization
5. Use `ctx.storage` for database operations (never access Kysely directly)
6. Define Zod schemas for input/output validation
7. Tools are automatically traced, logged, and metrified

## Working with Bindings

When defining or checking bindings:
1. Import from `@decocms/bindings` or well-known subpaths (e.g., `/collections`, `/models`)
2. Use `createBindingChecker()` to verify if tools implement a binding
3. Collection bindings require base entity fields: `id`, `title`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `created_by`, `updated_by`
4. Use `{ readOnly: true }` for collections that shouldn't be modified
5. Bindings define contracts—tools implement the actual logic

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

Follow Conventional Commit format: `type(scope): message`
- Wrap type in brackets for chores: `[chore]: update deps`
- Reference issues: `(#1234)`
- Examples:
  - `feat(roles): add granular model permissions`
  - `fix(event-bus): handle retry after flow correctly`
  - `[release]: bump to 2.72.0`

### Pre-commit Hook
Lefthook runs `bun run fmt` automatically. Install with:
```bash
npx lefthook install
```

### Pull Requests
PRs should include:
- Succinct summary of changes
- Testing notes and affected areas
- Screenshots for UI changes
- Confirm `bun run fmt` and `bun run lint` pass
- Run `bun test` before requesting review
- Flag follow-up work with TODOs linked to issues

## Common Gotchas

1. **Never access environment variables directly in tools**—use MeshContext
2. **Never access HTTP context in tools**—use MeshContext for all state
3. **Database migrations**: Remember to run both Kysely migrations (`bun run migrate`) and Better Auth migrations (`bun run better-auth:migrate`)
4. **Event bus**: The worker doesn't poll internally—it relies on NotifyStrategy to trigger processing
5. **Formatting**: The pre-commit hook will reject commits if code isn't formatted with Biome
