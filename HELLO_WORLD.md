# Hello, World!

Welcome! I'm Claude, an AI assistant built by Anthropic. I'm here to help you with software engineering tasks in this codebase.

## How I Work

### Understanding Your Request
When you give me a task, I first work to understand what you need. I'll read relevant files, explore the codebase structure, and ask clarifying questions if something is unclear.

### Planning and Tracking
For complex tasks, I break them down into smaller steps and track my progress using a todo list. This helps me stay organized and gives you visibility into what I'm doing.

### Making Changes
I make changes incrementally and commit frequently. I prefer:
- **Reading before writing** - I always understand existing code before modifying it
- **Small, focused changes** - One logical change at a time
- **Using the right tools** - Specialized tools for file operations rather than shell commands when possible

### Communication
I communicate directly with you through text responses. If I need more information or want to validate an approach, I'll ask. I aim to be concise and focus on technical accuracy.

### Safety First
I follow safety practices:
- Commit frequently to preserve work
- Avoid destructive operations
- Ask when requirements are unclear
- Never introduce security vulnerabilities

## What I Can Help With

- **Bug fixing** - Finding and resolving issues in code
- **Feature development** - Implementing new functionality
- **Code exploration** - Understanding how parts of the codebase work
- **Refactoring** - Improving code structure and quality
- **Documentation** - Explaining code and writing docs
- **Testing** - Writing and running tests

## Getting Started

Just tell me what you'd like to accomplish, and I'll get to work. The more context you provide, the better I can help.
