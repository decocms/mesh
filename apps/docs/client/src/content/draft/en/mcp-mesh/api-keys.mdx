## What are API Keys?

API keys let external systems connect to deco CMS without needing a user to log in. They're simple tokens you can use in scripts, automation tools, or any system that needs to access deco CMS programmatically.

<Callout type="warning">
  API keys are for **external systems connecting to deco CMS**. To connect deco CMS to upstream MCP servers, see [Connections](/en/mcp-mesh/connections).
</Callout>

## When to Use API Keys vs OAuth

**OAuth** (Recommended for most users)
- Use with Cursor, Claude Desktop, VS Code
- Login with your browser
- Easiest setup

**API Keys**
- Use for scripts and automation
- No browser login needed
- Better for servers and CI/CD

## Creating an API Key

1. Open the **deco CMS Dashboard**
2. Go to **Settings** → **API Keys**
3. Click **Create API Key**
4. Give it a name (like "My Automation Script")
5. Assign [roles and permissions](/en/mcp-mesh/user-management)
6. **Copy the key immediately**

<Callout type="error">
  You can only see the API key once. Copy it now and store it somewhere safe like a password manager.
</Callout>

## Using Your API Key

Add the API key to your MCP client configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "deco CMS": {
      "url": "https://mesh.deco CMS.com/mcp/agent/your-agent-id",
      "transport": "http",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer mcp_key_abc123..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Security Best Practices

<Callout type="warning">
  Treat API keys like passwords. Never share them or commit them to code repositories.
</Callout>

**Give minimum permissions**: Only grant what's actually needed.

**Create separate keys**: Use one key per tool or script—easier to manage if something goes wrong.

**Store securely**: Keep keys in a password manager or secrets manager, never in plain text files.

**Rotate regularly**: Create new keys every few months and delete old ones.

**Monitor usage**: Check the dashboard regularly for unusual activity.

<Callout type="tip">
  Combine API keys with [Agents](/en/mcp-mesh/agents) to control exactly which tools your scripts can access.
