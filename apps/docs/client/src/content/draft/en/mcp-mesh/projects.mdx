## What are Projects?

**Projects** are organizational units that leverage [Virtual MCPs](/en/mcp-mesh/virtual-mcps) to manage tools, resources, and prompts within a specific work context. Use projects to isolate capabilities by product, client, team, or initiative.

Projects provide:

- **Work organization** - Group capabilities by product line, client, or feature initiative
- **Scope isolation** - Each project operates with its own set of tools and credentials
- **Contextual configuration** - Project-specific guidelines, documentation, and workflows
- **Team boundaries** - Match your organizational structure with technical boundaries

Projects are available in the sidebar under the **Projects** section, where each operates as a self-contained workspace.

## How Projects Work

Create a project, then configure it by remixing capabilities:

1. **Name** - Identifies the project (e.g., "Mobile App Rewrite", "Client XYZ Portal")
2. **Description** - Explains the project's purpose, scope, and goals for your team
3. **Instructions** - Guidelines for how AI agents should work in this project (like `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md`)
4. **Tools** - Actions agents may take on this project (select from [connections](/en/mcp-mesh/connections) or create inline)
5. **Resources** - Extra info for detailed skills the agent may need (documentation, guidelines, domain knowledge)
6. **Prompts** - How users are supposed to use this project (detailed workflows that combine tools and resources to accomplish specific goals)

Since projects are [Virtual MCPs](/en/mcp-mesh/virtual-mcps), you get full composability—remix external capabilities with custom definitions to build exactly what your team needs.

## Example: Multi-Brand Storefront Project

A multi-brand storefront project might aggregate Shopify tools for product catalog management, Stripe tools for payment processing, analytics tools for conversion tracking, and brand-specific guidelines as resources. AI agents working in this project manage product listings, process orders, analyze sales performance, and follow brand standards—all within the project's isolated scope. Each brand gets its own project with isolated credentials and brand-specific configuration.

## Scope Isolation

Projects enforce boundaries through routing. When AI agents connect to a project, they:

- Access only tools configured for that project
- See project-specific resources and guidelines
- Operate within isolated credentials and permissions

Project A cannot access Project B's tools or credentials. Organization-level capabilities remain available across all projects.

## Use Cases

- **Multi-brand stores** - One project per brand with isolated product catalogs and credentials
- **Marketplace operations** - Separate vendor management, fulfillment, and customer service projects with distinct toolsets
- **Seasonal campaigns** - Temporary projects for holiday sales with curated marketing and inventory tools
- **B2B portals** - Projects as tenant boundaries for wholesale customer accounts with custom pricing and catalogs

## Why Use Projects?

- **Clear boundaries** - Prevent tool and credential cross-contamination between initiatives
- **Organized work** - Match technical scope to organizational structure
- **Flexible tooling** - Add or remove capabilities without infrastructure changes
- **Familiar patterns** - `.claude/` (project) and `~/.claude/` (global) convention
