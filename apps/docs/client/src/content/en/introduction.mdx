## What is deco CMS?

**deco CMS** is an open-source **Context Management System** for AI-native operations.

If MCP is the standard interface for tool access, deco CMS is the **production layer around it**: connect MCP servers, enforce governance, and get observability as usage scales across teams and environments. The broader platform also includes a **builder framework** (MCP Studio — coming soon, replacing the legacy admin) and **distribution capabilities** (pre-built modules and store).

**Official links:**

- **deco CMS**: [decocms.com](https://www.decocms.com/)
- **The MCP Mesh**: [decocms.com/mesh](https://www.decocms.com/mesh)
- **MCP Studio**: [decocms.com/mcp-studio](https://www.decocms.com/mcp-studio)

If you know us from before (as **deco.cx**) and you’re looking for **headless CMS + storefront** capabilities, visit [deco.cx](https://www.decocms.com/use-case/deco-cx). See the deco.cx docs at [docs.deco.cx](https://docs.deco.cx/en/getting-started/overview).

## Quick start (Mesh)

### Option A: one-command local Mesh setup

```bash
npx @decocms/mesh
```

### Option B: run from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/decocms/mesh.git
cd mesh
bun install
bun run dev
```

## Deploy (Mesh)

- **[Local: Docker Compose](/en/mcp-mesh/deploy/local-docker-compose)**
- **[Kubernetes: Helm Chart](/en/mcp-mesh/deploy/kubernetes-helm-chart)**

<Callout type="warning">
  **Docs split (quick guide):**

  - **The MCP Mesh** → Self-hosting, deploying, and operating the Mesh (recommended).
  - **Legacy Admin** → If you’re using `admin.decocms.com` (still supported, **deprecated soon**).

  We’re launching **MCP Studio** (on top of Mesh), which will bring the current SaaS admin capabilities to the Mesh (including a hosted option by us) and replace the legacy SaaS over time.

## Problem (and what the Mesh fixes)

When AI moves from demos to production, teams usually hit the same constraints:

- **Governance gaps**: no single place to enforce SSO/RBAC, approvals, and audit trails
- **Integration sprawl**: every client wires every tool with its own retries, auth, and config
- **Operational blind spots**: debugging is slow; failures and costs are hard to trace end-to-end
- **Context obesity**: bloated prompts and tool lists degrade quality and increase cost

The MCP Mesh centralizes those cross-cutting concerns **once** so you don’t rebuild them in every agent/app.

## Platform structure: Mesh → Studio → Distribution

### The MCP Mesh (foundation)
An open-source **control plane for MCP traffic**. It sits between your MCP clients (Cursor, Claude, VS Code, custom agents) and your MCP servers, providing a unified layer for auth, policy, and observability.

### MCP Studio (development)
A no-code admin + SDK to package MCP capabilities as reusable building blocks.

<Callout type="info">
  **Coming soon:** This is the successor to the current SaaS admin, built on top of the MCP Mesh.
</Callout>

### MCP Apps & Store (distribution)
A path to distribute reusable MCP-native capabilities across teams (and eventually a store).

<Callout type="info">
  **Coming soon.**
</Callout>

## Why MCP?

We’re built on MCP because enterprises need interoperability at the tool layer — and a way to operate that tool access with the rigor of any production surface.

MCP gives you a standard interface. deco CMS provides the **control plane** around it:

- **Portable**: self-host on Docker/Kubernetes; cloud hosted option coming soon
- **Composable**: swap models, swap MCP servers, adopt community tools, build your own
- **Auditable**: centralized policies, logs, and traces across tool + model calls
- **No lock-in**: your context, your infrastructure

## Legacy Admin quick start (admin.decocms.com)

If you’re using the current SaaS admin at `admin.decocms.com` (still supported, deprecated soon), start here:
