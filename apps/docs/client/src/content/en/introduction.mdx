## What is deco CMS?

**deco CMS** is an open-source **Context Management System** for AI-native operations.

If MCP is the standard interface for tool access, deco CMS is the **production layer around it**: connect MCP servers, enforce governance, and get observability as usage scales across teams and environments. The broader platform also includes a **builder framework** (MCP Studio — coming soon) and **distribution capabilities** (pre-built modules and store).

- **MCP Studio**: [decocms.com/mcp-studio](https://www.decocms.com/mcp-studio)

If you know us from before (as **deco.cx**) and you're looking for **headless CMS + storefront** capabilities, visit [deco.cx](https://www.decocms.com/use-case/deco-cx). See the deco.cx docs at [docs.deco.cx](https://docs.deco.cx/en/getting-started/overview).

## Start with the MCP Mesh

Choose one:

### Option A: one-command local setup (npx)

```bash
npx @decocms/mesh
```

### Option B: local setup with Docker Compose

```bash
# 1. Configure environment variables
# Edit .env and configure BETTER_AUTH_SECRET (required)
# Generate a secret: openssl rand -base64 32
cp conf-examples/env.example .env

# 2. Configure authentication
cp conf-examples/auth-config.json.example auth-config.json

# 3. Start the application
docker compose up -d

# 4. Access
open http://localhost:3000
```

**More details:** [Local: Docker Compose](/en/mcp-mesh/deploy/local-docker-compose)

### Option C: run from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/decocms/mesh.git
cd mesh
bun install
bun run dev
```

### Option D: deploy to Kubernetes (Helm)

```bash
# 1. Generate a secure secret for authentication
SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)

# 2. Install the chart with the generated secret
helm install deco-mcp-mesh . \
  --namespace deco-mcp-mesh \
  --create-namespace \
  --set secret.BETTER_AUTH_SECRET="$SECRET"

# 3. Wait for pods to be ready
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod \
  -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=deco-mcp-mesh \
  -n deco-mcp-mesh \
  --timeout=300s

# 4. Access via port-forward
kubectl port-forward svc/deco-mcp-mesh 8080:80 -n deco-mcp-mesh
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Learn the Mesh (concepts + product surfaces)

- **[MCP Mesh Overview](/en/mcp-mesh/overview)**
- **[Quickstart](/en/mcp-mesh/quickstart)**
- **[Concepts](/en/mcp-mesh/concepts)**
- **[Connections](/en/mcp-mesh/mcp-servers)**
- **[MCP Agents](/en/mcp-mesh/mcp-gateways)**
- **[API Keys](/en/mcp-mesh/api-keys)**
- **[Monitoring](/en/mcp-mesh/monitoring)**

<Callout type="warning">
  **Docs split (quick guide):**

  - **The MCP Mesh** → Self-hosting, deploying, and operating the Mesh (recommended).
  - **Legacy Admin** → If you're using `admin.decocms.com` (still supported, **deprecated soon**).

  We're launching **MCP Studio** (on top of the Mesh), which will bring the current SaaS admin capabilities to the Mesh (including a hosted option by us) and replace the legacy SaaS over time.

## Problem: the production gap

AI is easy to demo and hard to **operate**.

As tool surfaces and teams grow, most orgs run into the same production constraints:

- **Autonomy breaks**: shipping gets bottlenecked by bespoke integrations, security reviews, and platform tickets
- **Context fragments**: knowledge lives across many systems and teams rebuild connectors and retrieval repeatedly
- **Governance is inconsistent**: no single place for SSO/RBAC, audit trails, and operational visibility

For more context on our platform-level thesis, read [The architecture of an AI-native company](https://www.decocms.com/blog/post/ai-native-company).

## Platform structure: Mesh → Studio → Apps & Store

### The MCP Mesh (foundation)
An open-source **control plane for MCP traffic**. It sits between your MCP clients (Cursor, Claude, VS Code, custom agents) and your MCP servers, providing a unified layer for auth, policy, and observability.

### MCP Studio (development)
A no-code admin + SDK to package MCP capabilities as reusable building blocks.

<Callout type="info">
  **Coming soon:** This is the successor to the current SaaS admin, built on top of the MCP Mesh.
</Callout>

### MCP Apps & Store (distribution)
A path to distribute reusable MCP-native capabilities across teams (and eventually a store).

<Callout type="info">
  **Coming soon.**
</Callout>

## Why MCP?

We're built on MCP because enterprises need interoperability at the tool layer — and a way to operate that tool access with the rigor of any production surface.

MCP gives you a standard interface. deco CMS provides the **control plane** around it:

- **Portable**: self-host on Docker/Kubernetes; cloud hosted option coming soon
- **Composable**: swap models, swap MCP servers, adopt community tools, build your own
- **Auditable**: centralized policies, logs, and traces across tool + model calls
- **No lock-in**: your context, your infrastructure

## Legacy Admin quick start (admin.decocms.com)

If you're using the current SaaS admin at `admin.decocms.com` (still supported, deprecated soon), start here:
