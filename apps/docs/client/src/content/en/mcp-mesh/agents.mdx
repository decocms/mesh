## What Are Agents?

**Agents** are single-purpose virtual MCPs optimized for specific tasks. While [Projects](/en/mcp-mesh/projects) provide general-purpose work environments, agents focus narrowly on accomplishing one thing well.

Agents provide:

- **Focused capabilities** - Curated tools for specific tasks
- **Task-specific context** - Resources and guidelines tailored to the agent's purpose
- **Single-purpose design** - Clear objective with no unnecessary complexity

Agents are available in the sidebar under the **Agents** section, where each operates as a focused workspace for its specific task.

The key distinction: projects organize capabilities for broad work contexts, while agents optimize for single-purpose execution.

## How Agents Work

Create an agent by defining its purpose and curating its capabilities:

1. **Name** - Identifies the agent (e.g., "Deployment Agent", "Research Agent")
2. **Purpose** - Clear statement of what the agent does (e.g., "Deploy applications to production")
3. **Tools** - Actions the agent can take (select from [connections](/en/mcp-mesh/connections) or define inline)
4. **Resources** - Context and guidelines specific to the agent's task
5. **Prompts** - Templates tailored to the agent's workflow

Since agents are [Virtual MCPs](/en/mcp-mesh/virtual-mcps), you can compose them from existing connections, define capabilities inline, or mix both approaches. The agent's configuration determines what it can do and how it operates.

## Example: Production Deployment Agent

A deployment agent might aggregate GitHub tools for tagging and releases, Slack tools for notifications, and monitoring tools for health checks. The agent handles production deployments with a focused toolset—create tags, merge PRs, post deployment notifications, verify health—all within its single-purpose scope.

## Built-in Agents

MCP Mesh includes built-in agents for common mesh operations. These agents use the **Mesh MCP**—a self-referential MCP that exposes mesh management capabilities through the MCP protocol.

Built-in agents available out-of-the-box:

- **Agent Management** - Create, edit, and delete agents
- **Connection Management** - Manage MCP server connections
- **Permission Management** - Control access and authorization
- **MCP Store** - Browse and install MCPs from the store
- **User Management** - Invite and manage organization members

These agents operate at organization level and leverage mesh MCP tools for platform configuration.

## Agent Design Principles

**Single-purpose focus**: Each agent should do one thing well. Narrow scope improves clarity, reliability, and maintainability.

**Clear purpose statement**: Define agents with `[Verb] + [Object] + [Context]` pattern:
- "Deploy applications to production environments"
- "Analyze test coverage for code quality"
- "Manage agent lifecycle in the organization"

**Tool selection**: Choose tools that align with the agent's purpose. A research agent needs read-only tools; a deployment agent needs release and notification tools. Overly broad tool access dilutes focus.

**Good**: "Deployment Agent" (deploys to production)
**Too broad**: "DevOps Agent" (deploys, monitors, manages infrastructure, handles incidents...)

## Using Agents

Agents can be used in several ways:

- **Spawned by decopilot** - Agents created on-demand with fresh context for specific tasks
- **Built-in agents** - Pre-configured agents for mesh operations, ready immediately
- **Custom agents** - Domain-specific agents for your team's unique workflows

When working with an agent, you'll only see the tools, resources, and prompts configured for that agent's specific purpose. This focused view helps you stay on task without distraction.

## Benefits Summary

Agents provide focused capabilities with clear advantages:

- **Focused capabilities** - Single-purpose design ensures clarity and reliability
- **Fresh context** - Spawned agents start with clean context for their task
- **Reusable patterns** - Define once, use across projects and workflows
- **Built-in operations** - Pre-configured agents for common mesh tasks
- **Self-referential management** - Mesh MCP enables agents to manage mesh itself
