## What Are Agents?

**Agents** are single-purpose virtual MCPs optimized for specific tasks. While [Projects](/en/mcp-mesh/projects) provide general-purpose work environments, agents focus narrowly on accomplishing one thing well.

Agents are built on the [Virtual MCP](/en/mcp-mesh/virtual-mcps) foundation—they ARE virtual MCPs with their own tools, resources, prompts, and configuration. This makes agents first-class participants in your MCP ecosystem, exposing capabilities through standard MCP protocol endpoints at `/:org/agents/:agent_id`.

The key distinction: projects organize capabilities for broad work contexts, while agents optimize for single-purpose execution.

## How Agents Work

Create an agent by defining its purpose and curating its capabilities:

1. **Name** - Identifies the agent (e.g., "Deployment Agent", "Research Agent")
2. **Purpose** - Clear statement of what the agent does (e.g., "Deploy applications to production")
3. **Tools** - Actions the agent can take (select from [connections](/en/mcp-mesh/connections) or define inline)
4. **Resources** - Context and guidelines specific to the agent's task
5. **Prompts** - Templates tailored to the agent's workflow

Since agents are [Virtual MCPs](/en/mcp-mesh/virtual-mcps), you can compose them from existing connections, define capabilities inline, or mix both approaches. The agent's configuration determines what it can do and how it operates.

## Example: Production Deployment Agent

A deployment agent might aggregate GitHub tools for tagging and releases, Slack tools for notifications, and monitoring tools for health checks. The agent handles production deployments with a focused toolset—create tags, merge PRs, post deployment notifications, verify health—all within its single-purpose scope.

## Built-in Agents

MCP Mesh includes built-in agents for common mesh operations. These agents use the **Mesh MCP**—a self-referential MCP that exposes mesh management capabilities through the MCP protocol.

Built-in agents available out-of-the-box:

- **Agent Management** - Create, edit, and delete agents
- **Connection Management** - Manage MCP server connections
- **Permission Management** - Control access and authorization
- **MCP Store** - Browse and install MCPs from the store
- **User Management** - Invite and manage organization members

These agents operate at organization level and leverage mesh MCP tools for platform configuration.

## Agent Design Principles

**Single-purpose focus**: Each agent should do one thing well. Narrow scope improves clarity, reliability, and maintainability.

**Clear purpose statement**: Define agents with `[Verb] + [Object] + [Context]` pattern:
- "Deploy applications to production environments"
- "Analyze test coverage for code quality"
- "Manage agent lifecycle in the organization"

**Tool selection**: Choose tools that align with the agent's purpose. A research agent needs read-only tools; a deployment agent needs release and notification tools. Overly broad tool access dilutes focus.

**Good**: "Deployment Agent" (deploys to production)
**Too broad**: "DevOps Agent" (deploys, monitors, manages infrastructure, handles incidents...)

## Using Agents

Agents can be used in several ways:

- **Spawned by decopilot** - Agents spawned on-demand with fresh context for specific tasks
- **Built-in agents** - Pre-configured agents for mesh operations, ready immediately
- **Custom agents** - Domain-specific agents for your team's unique workflows
- **Direct connection** - Connect MCP clients to agent endpoints for focused sessions

When working within an agent, you operate in **agent scope**—tools, resources, and prompts are limited to those configured for the agent. Operations are bounded by the agent's capabilities.

## Benefits Summary

Agents provide focused capabilities with clear advantages:

- **Focused capabilities** - Single-purpose design ensures clarity and reliability
- **Fresh context** - Spawned agents start with clean context for their task
- **Reusable patterns** - Define once, use across projects and workflows
- **Built-in operations** - Pre-configured agents for common mesh tasks
- **Self-referential management** - Mesh MCP enables agents to manage mesh itself
