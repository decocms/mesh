## What Are Agents?

**Agents** are single-purpose virtual MCPs optimized for specific tasks. While [Projects](/en/mcp-mesh/projects) provide general-purpose work environments, agents focus narrowly on accomplishing one thing well.

Agents provide:

- **Focused capabilities** - Curated tools for specific tasks
- **Task-specific context** - Resources and guidelines tailored to the agent's purpose
- **Single-purpose design** - Clear objective with no unnecessary complexity

Agents are organization-wide configurations available in the sidebar under the **Agents** section. Each agent can be spawned in any scope (tasks, subtasks, projects) with fresh execution context, providing a focused workspace for its specific task.

The key distinction: projects organize capabilities for broad work contexts, while agents optimize for single-purpose execution.

## How Agents Work

Agents follow the same pattern as standard agent skills (`SKILL.md` files), making them familiar and easy to understand:

**Like SKILL.md skills:**
- **Description** - Brief explanation of what the agent does and when to use it (like the `description:` field in `SKILL.md`)
- **Instructions** - Detailed guidelines for how the agent operates (like the body of a `SKILL.md` file)

**Plus Virtual MCP capabilities:**
- **Name** - Identifies the agent (e.g., "Deployment Agent", "Research Agent")
- **Tools** - Actions the agent can take (select from [connections](/en/mcp-mesh/connections) or define inline)
- **Resources** - Additional context and documentation
- **Prompts** - Workflow templates

[decopilot](/en/mcp-mesh/decopilot/overview) uses the **description** field to understand when to spawn each agent—just like it uses skill descriptions to know when to invoke skills. This makes agents discoverable and automatically available when relevant to the task at hand.

Since agents are [Virtual MCPs](/en/mcp-mesh/virtual-mcps), you can compose them from existing connections, define capabilities inline, or mix both approaches.

## Example: Production Deployment Agent

A deployment agent might aggregate GitHub tools for tagging and releases, Slack tools for notifications, and monitoring tools for health checks. The agent handles production deployments with a focused toolset—create tags, merge PRs, post deployment notifications, verify health—all within its single-purpose scope.

## Built-in Agents

decocms includes built-in agents for common mesh operations. These agents use the **Management MCP**—a self-referential MCP that exposes mesh management capabilities through the MCP protocol.

Built-in agents available out-of-the-box:

- **Agent Management** - Create, edit, and delete agents
- **Connection Management** - Manage MCP server connections
- **Permission Management** - Control access and authorization
- **MCP Store** - Browse and install MCPs from the store
- **User Management** - Invite and manage organization members

These agents operate at organization level and leverage Management MCP tools for platform configuration.

## Agent Design Principles

**Single-purpose focus**: Each agent should do one thing well. Narrow scope improves clarity, reliability, and maintainability.

**Clear description**: Write descriptions that help decopilot understand when to spawn the agent. Use `[Verb] + [Object] + [Context]` pattern:
- "Deploy applications to production environments"
- "Analyze test coverage for code quality"
- "Manage agent lifecycle in the organization"

**Detailed instructions**: Provide clear guidelines in the instructions field—just like you would in a `SKILL.md` file. Include constraints, workflow steps, and behavioral guidelines.

**Tool selection**: Choose tools that align with the agent's description. A research agent needs read-only tools; a deployment agent needs release and notification tools. Overly broad tool access dilutes focus.

**Good**: "Deployment Agent" (deploys to production)
**Too broad**: "DevOps Agent" (deploys, monitors, manages infrastructure, handles incidents...)

## Using Agents

Agents can be used in several ways:

- **Spawned by decopilot** - Agents created on-demand with fresh context for specific tasks
- **Built-in agents** - Pre-configured agents for mesh operations, ready immediately
- **Custom agents** - Domain-specific agents for your team's unique workflows

When working with an agent, you'll only see the tools, resources, and prompts configured for that agent's specific purpose. This focused view helps you stay on task without distraction.

## Benefits Summary

Agents provide focused capabilities with clear advantages:

- **Focused capabilities** - Single-purpose design ensures clarity and reliability
- **Fresh context** - Spawned agents start with clean context for their task
- **Reusable patterns** - Define once, use across projects and workflows
- **Built-in operations** - Pre-configured agents for common mesh tasks
- **Self-referential management** - Management MCP enables agents to manage mesh itself
