## What are API keys for?

API keys are the simplest way to give an agent/app access to the Mesh without an interactive login flow. Keys are:

- **scoped** (explicit permissions)
- **revocable**
- **auditable** (calls show up in Monitoring)

## Best practices

- **Least privilege**: only grant the tool permissions you need.
- **Separate keys per workload**: one key per app/agent is easier to rotate.
- **Use agents for surface control**: combine API-key permissions with a curated agent.

<Callout type="warning">
  Treat API keys like production secrets. Store them in a secrets manager and rotate regularly.
