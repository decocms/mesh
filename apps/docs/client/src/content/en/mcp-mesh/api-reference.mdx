## MCP endpoints

### Management MCP

- `POST /mcp`

This endpoint exposes **management tools** via MCP (orgs, connections, agents, API keys, monitoring, event bus).

### Connection proxy

- `POST /mcp/:connectionId`

Proxies MCP requests to a single upstream connection.

### Agent (virtual server)

- `POST /mcp/:connectionId` (where `connectionId` is the Agent's connection ID)

Agents are virtual MCPs stored as connections with `connection_type = 'VIRTUAL'`. They aggregate tools/resources/prompts across multiple connections. Supports `?mode=` query parameter for tool selection strategy (passthrough, smart_tool_selection, code_execution).

## OAuth discovery

- `GET /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`
- `GET /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`

## Ops

- `GET /health`
- `GET /metrics`
