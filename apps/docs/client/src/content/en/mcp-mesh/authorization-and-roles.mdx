## The model

The Mesh enforces access control at two layers:

- **Organization roles** (member permissions inside an org)
- **Tool permissions** (what an API key or user session is allowed to call)

## Roles (built-in + custom)

Every organization starts with three default roles:

- **Owner**: full access (including sensitive actions like deletes)
- **Admin**: elevated access for day-to-day operations
- **User**: least privilege by default

You can also create **custom roles** with granular permissions:

- Go to **Members** → **Manage Roles**
- Create a new role
- Select which organization permissions that role can perform (tool-scoped toggles)

## API key permissions (tool-scoped)

API keys are created with explicit permissions for specific management tools (and, when applicable, proxied tool usage).

<Callout type="tip">
  Treat permissions like production infrastructure: default to least privilege and grant only what a client needs.
</Callout>

## Where this shows up in the product

- **Members**: manage roles and invitations
- **API Keys**: create/update/delete keys and restrict permissions
- **Gateways**: expose only the desired tool surface (include/exclude strategies)
