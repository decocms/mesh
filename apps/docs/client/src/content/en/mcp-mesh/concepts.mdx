## Core Entities

- **Organization**: the top-level tenant boundary. Everything (connections, agents, projects, logs) is org-scoped.
- **Members**: users invited into an organization with specific roles and permissions.
- **Connection**: a configured upstream MCP endpoint (usually HTTP), optionally with stored credentials. See [Connections](/en/mcp-mesh/connections).
- **Virtual MCP**: aggregates tools/resources/prompts from connected servers into a single MCP. See [Virtual MCPs](/en/mcp-mesh/virtual-mcps).
- **Agent**: single-purpose Virtual MCPs optimized for specific tasks. See [Agents](/en/mcp-mesh/agents).
- **Project**: Virtual MCPs to organize project-specific tools, resources, prompts, and config. See [Projects](/en/mcp-mesh/projects).

## Understanding Agents vs. Projects

Both agents and projects are Virtual MCPs, but they serve different purposes in your workflow:

**Projects** are general-purpose organizational units for ongoing work:
- **Broad scope** - Cover multiple workflows and capabilities within a work context
- **Long-lived** - Evolve over time as work progresses
- **Team collaboration** - Shared workspace for team members
- **Example** - "Mobile App Rewrite" project with design, development, and deployment tools
- **When to use** - Organizing work by product line, client, team, or initiative

**Agents** are organization-wide configurations that can be spawned in any context:
- **Narrow scope** - Clear, focused objective with curated toolset
- **Task-specific** - Designed for particular operations or workflows
- **Fresh execution state** - Each spawn starts with clean context in tasks, subtasks, or projects
- **Example** - "Agent Management Agent" that only creates/edits/deletes agents
- **When to use** - Focused operations, built-in mesh management, or specialized workflows

Both follow the same Virtual MCP architecture, but their design principles differ: projects organize capabilities for broad work contexts, while agents are reusable configurations that can be instantiated on-demand with fresh execution state.

## MCP Protocol Primitives

deco CMS is fully [MCP compliant](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/). The Model Context Protocol defines three core primitives:

- **[Tools](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools)**: Executable functions exposed by MCP servers that enable AI agents to take actions (create files, query databases, call APIs, etc.).
- **[Resources](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/resources)**: Read-only data sources with URIs (like `org://`, `project://`, `agent://`) that provide context to AI agents.
- **[Prompts](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/prompts)**: Reusable templates with variables for common workflows and operations.

deco CMS works exclusively with MCP-compliant clients and servers, providing a standard protocol layer for AI agent communication. For the complete protocol architecture, see the [Model Context Protocol documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/architecture).

## Platform Capabilities

### User Management & Access Control

deco CMS provides organization-level user management with fine-grained permissions:

- **Multi-user organizations** - Invite team members and manage their access
- **Role-based permissions** - Control what users can see and do within the organization
- **API key management** - Generate scoped API keys for programmatic access
- **Connection-level permissions** - Restrict tool access per connection (e.g., read-only GitHub access)

See [User Management](/en/mcp-mesh/user-management) for details on managing team access.

### Security & Credential Management

- **Credential Vault**: Connection credentials are encrypted at rest and only decrypted at request time
- **Least privilege**: API keys and permissions are scoped to specific tools
- **Audit logs**: Every tool invocation is logged with caller identity, inputs, and outputs
- **Zero trust**: All requests are authenticated and authorized, regardless of source

### Built-in Monitoring

deco CMS includes first-class monitoring for all MCP traffic:

- **Tool invocation logs**: See every tool call with inputs, outputs, timing, and caller
- **Request tracing**: Follow requests across multiple MCP servers
- **Replay & debug**: Replay past tool invocations to understand behavior
- **Usage analytics**: Understand which tools and capabilities are being used

See [Monitoring](/en/mcp-mesh/monitoring) for details.

## How the Platform Works

deco CMS sits between MCP clients and MCP servers, providing a unified control layer:

```
┌─────────┐                    ┌──────────┐                  ┌────────────┐
│ Client  │ ──[authenticate]──▶│ deco CMS │ ──[with creds]──▶│ MCP Server │
│ (Cursor)│                    │          │                  │  (GitHub)  │
└─────────┘ ◀──[response]──────└──────────┘ ◀─[response]─────└────────────┘
                                     │
                                     └──▶ [audit log]
```

### Request Flow

1. **Client authenticates** to deco CMS (OAuth session or API key)
2. **Client makes request** to a Connection, Agent, Project, or the Management MCP
3. **deco CMS authorizes** the request against the client's permissions
4. **deco CMS loads credentials** from the encrypted vault for the target Connection(s)
5. **deco CMS proxies** the MCP protocol request to the upstream server(s)
6. **deco CMS logs** the invocation for monitoring and audit
7. **deco CMS returns** the response to the client

This flow ensures clients never handle credentials directly, all access is authorized consistently, and every operation is observable.

## Architectural Patterns

### Multi-Tenancy Through Organizations

Organizations provide the top-level isolation boundary. Everything in deco CMS is **organization-scoped**:

- Connections, Virtual MCPs, Projects, and Agents are organization-specific
- Credentials stored in isolated vaults per organization
- Members, roles, and permissions are organization-scoped
- Monitoring logs and audit trails isolated per organization

This multi-tenancy model enables SaaS providers to serve multiple customers, enterprises to separate departments, and agencies to isolate client organizations.

### Composition Over Configuration

deco CMS follows a **composition model** rather than requiring complex configuration:

**Connect** individual MCP servers (GitHub, Slack, databases)
↓
**Compose** them into Virtual MCPs with curated tool surfaces
↓
**Organize** into Projects (for teams) and Agents (for specific tasks)
↓
**Expose** through a single MCP-compliant endpoint

This pattern enables building complex capabilities from simple, reusable components without infrastructure changes or deployments.

## Design Decisions

### Why Virtual MCPs Are Editable

Traditional MCP servers expose a fixed set of tools defined in their code. deco CMS's Virtual MCPs are **editable at runtime** because they're configuration, not code. This enables:

- **Dynamic tool surfaces**: Add or remove tools without deployments
- **Resource creation**: Generate documentation and context on the fly
- **Prompt evolution**: Update templates based on usage patterns
- **No-code workflows**: Non-developers can compose capabilities

This editability is why Projects and Agents are Virtual MCPs—they need to evolve as work progresses.

### Why Monitoring is Built-In

In traditional MCP deployments, observability is an afterthought—each client logs independently (or not at all), and there's no unified view of tool usage. deco CMS makes monitoring **first-class** by logging every tool invocation that flows through the platform.

This built-in monitoring enables:
- **Debugging**: Trace failures across multiple MCP servers
- **Cost visibility**: See which tools are expensive or slow
- **Usage patterns**: Understand which capabilities teams actually use
- **Security audit**: Track who accessed what, when, and why

### Why the MCP Protocol

deco CMS could have invented its own protocol for agent-tool communication, but building on MCP provides:

- **Ecosystem compatibility**: Works with any MCP-compliant client (Claude Desktop, Cursor) and server
- **Standard semantics**: Tools, Resources, and Prompts have well-defined meanings
- **Open specification**: MCP is vendor-neutral and evolving through community input
- **Network effects**: As the MCP ecosystem grows, deco CMS users benefit automatically

By being MCP-native, deco CMS becomes infrastructure for the broader ecosystem, not a proprietary silo.
