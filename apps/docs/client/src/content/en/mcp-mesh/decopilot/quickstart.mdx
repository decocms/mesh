This guide shows you how to use decopilot for common e-commerce tasks. We'll start simple and progressively introduce features like subtasks, agents, context management, and scopes as you need them.

<Callout type="info" title="Progressive Learning">
Each section builds on the previous one. Feel free to skip ahead if you're already familiar with basic concepts.
</Callout>

## Prerequisites

Before starting, you'll need:

- **Access to a deco CMS organization** with at least one project
- **Connected integrations** like Shopify, GitHub, or other MCP servers (recommended but not required)
- **Basic familiarity** with your e-commerce platform

If you haven't set up integrations yet, see [Connections](/en/mcp-mesh/connections).

## 1. Simple Requests

Just ask decopilot for what you need in natural language. Behind the scenes, decopilot follows a three-step flow:

1. **Search** - Discovers what tools are available for your request
2. **Enable** - Activates the specific tools it needs
3. **Execute** - Uses those tools to accomplish your task

You don't need to tell decopilot which tools to use—it figures this out automatically based on what you ask for.

### Example: Check Inventory

```
You → "Check inventory levels for products below 20 units"
     ↓
Decopilot searches for inventory tools
     ↓
Decopilot enables inventory tools
     ↓
Decopilot queries your inventory system
     ↓
You ← "Found 8 products with low stock:
       • SKU-2847: 12 units (Wireless Headphones)
       • SKU-1923: 8 units (Phone Case - Black)
       • SKU-4156: 15 units (Laptop Stand)
       • SKU-3891: 5 units (USB-C Cable 2m)
       • SKU-5672: 18 units (Water Bottle)
       • SKU-7234: 9 units (Desk Lamp)
       • SKU-8901: 14 units (Keyboard - Mechanical)
       • SKU-4523: 7 units (Mouse Pad - Large)"
```

Decopilot automatically discovers and enables the tools it needs—you don't have to tell it which tools to use.

### Example: Update Product Descriptions

```
You → "Update descriptions for the summer collection
       to emphasize breathable fabrics and UV protection"
     ↓
Decopilot searches for product management tools
     ↓
Decopilot enables needed tools
     ↓
Decopilot identifies summer collection products
     ↓
Decopilot updates 24 product descriptions
     ↓
You ← "Updated 24 products in Summer 2026 collection:
       ✓ Added 'breathable fabric' mentions
       ✓ Highlighted UPF 50+ sun protection
       ✓ Emphasized lightweight materials

       Preview: example.com/products/summer-dress-azure"
```

### Example: Find Missing Content

```
You → "Find products missing images or descriptions"
     ↓
Decopilot searches for content audit tools
     ↓
Decopilot enables tools and scans catalog
     ↓
You ← "Found 12 products with missing content:

       Missing images (5):
       • SKU-8821: Ceramic Mug Set
       • SKU-9234: Garden Tool Kit
       • SKU-7755: Yoga Mat - Purple
       • SKU-6543: Plant Hanger - Macrame
       • SKU-8192: Candle - Lavender

       Missing descriptions (7):
       • SKU-3421: Travel Backpack
       • SKU-5667: Stainless Steel Thermos
       • SKU-2198: Notebook - Dotted
       • SKU-4456: Pen Set - Gel
       • SKU-9981: Desk Organizer
       • SKU-7722: Wall Clock - Wooden
       • SKU-3388: Picture Frame - 8x10"
```

**Key takeaway:** For straightforward tasks, just describe what you want. Decopilot automatically discovers and enables the right tools, then executes your request.

## 2. Using Subtasks for Heavy Work

When tasks involve analyzing lots of data or doing complex research, use **subtasks**. Subtasks run in isolated context and return just a summary—keeping your main conversation clean and focused.

### When to Use Subtasks

- Analyzing data across many products or orders
- Research tasks (competitor pricing, trend analysis)
- Quality audits (checking data consistency, finding errors)
- Any work that generates verbose output you don't need to see in full

### Example: Analyze Stock Ruptures

```
You → "Run a subtask to analyze potential stock ruptures
       across all warehouses for the next 30 days"
     ↓
Subtask starts with fresh context
     ↓
Subtask searches for inventory & analytics tools
     ↓
Subtask enables needed tools
     ↓
Subtask analyzes:
  • 547 SKUs across 3 warehouses
  • Historical sales data
  • Seasonal trends
  • Supplier lead times
     ↓
You ← "Stock Rupture Analysis Complete

       CRITICAL (need immediate action):
       • SKU-2847 Wireless Headphones
         Current: 12 units | Projected shortage: Feb 18
         Recommendation: Order 200 units from Supplier A

       • SKU-7234 Desk Lamp
         Current: 9 units | Projected shortage: Feb 15
         Recommendation: Order 150 units from Supplier B

       HIGH PRIORITY (order within 1 week):
       • SKU-8901 Mechanical Keyboard - 14 units
       • SKU-4156 Laptop Stand - 15 units
       • SKU-1923 Phone Case Black - 8 units

       MODERATE (monitor closely):
       • 8 additional SKUs flagged

       Full analysis saved to subtask history."
```

### Example: Research Competitor Pricing

```
You → "Run a subtask: research competitor pricing
       for our top 20 bestselling products"
     ↓
Subtask searches for web research & pricing tools
     ↓
Subtask enables tools and analyzes competitor sites
     ↓
You ← "Pricing Analysis Summary:

       OVERPRICED (consider reducing):
       • Wireless Headphones: Our $79 vs avg $65
       • Laptop Stand: Our $45 vs avg $35

       COMPETITIVE (maintain):
       • Phone Cases: Our $18 vs avg $17
       • USB Cables: Our $12 vs avg $13

       UNDERPRICED (opportunity to increase):
       • Mechanical Keyboard: Our $89 vs avg $110
       • Desk Lamp: Our $32 vs avg $42

       Full competitor breakdown in subtask history."
```

**Key takeaway:** Use subtasks when you need analysis or research but only want to see the actionable summary. The full details are saved in task history if you need them later.

## 3. Working with Specialist Agents

**Agents** are specialists with focused expertise in specific domains. When you need specialized analysis or domain knowledge, use an agent—they run in subtasks with tools and instructions tailored to their area.

### Available Agent Types

Common agents for e-commerce teams:
- **Inventory Specialist** - Demand forecasting, stock optimization, supplier coordination
- **Shipping & Logistics** - Route optimization, carrier selection, delivery scheduling
- **Customer Service** - Support strategy, communication planning, issue resolution
- **Content Specialist** - SEO optimization, copy refinement, brand consistency
- **Pricing Analyst** - Market analysis, competitive positioning, promotion strategy

### Example: Demand Forecasting

```
You → "Use the Inventory Specialist to forecast
       demand for winter collection launch"
     ↓
Decopilot searches for agents
     ↓
Decopilot → "Found 2 agents:
             • Inventory Specialist (recommended)
             • Supply Chain Analyst

             Which would you prefer?"
     ↓
You → "Inventory Specialist"
     ↓
Agent spawns in subtask with specialized scope
     ↓
Agent searches for forecasting & inventory tools
     ↓
Agent enables domain-specific tools
     ↓
Agent analyzes with specialized expertise
     ↓
You ← "Winter Collection Demand Forecast

       HIGH DEMAND (stock heavily):
       • Wool Scarves: 850-1100 units
       • Insulated Boots: 650-800 units
       • Fleece Jackets: 920-1200 units

       MODERATE DEMAND:
       • Winter Gloves: 400-550 units
       • Thermal Leggings: 350-480 units

       STRATEGY RECOMMENDATIONS:
       ✓ Order 70% of forecasted volume upfront
       ✓ Schedule second shipment for mid-season
       ✓ Monitor sell-through weekly
       ✓ Plan flash sales if inventory exceeds 40% after Week 4

       Detailed forecast model in agent task history."
```

### Example: Shipping Optimization

```
You → "Use Shipping Agent to optimize delivery
       routes for holiday orders"
     ↓
Agent spawns with logistics & shipping scope
     ↓
Agent searches for routing & carrier tools
     ↓
Agent enables specialized logistics tools
     ↓
Agent analyzes delivery optimization
     ↓
You ← "Holiday Shipping Strategy

       ROUTE OPTIMIZATION:
       • West Coast: Use Carrier A (2-day) - saves $3.20/order
       • East Coast: Use Carrier B (priority) - saves $1.80/order
       • Midwest: Split between A & B based on weight

       COST SAVINGS: $8,400/month projected

       CARRIER RECOMMENDATIONS:
       ✓ Negotiate volume discount with Carrier A (15%)
       ✓ Set up weekend pickups with Carrier B
       ✓ Reserve backup capacity with Carrier C for peak days

       Implementation plan in agent history."
```

**Key takeaway:** Agents bring specialized knowledge to complex tasks. They analyze with domain expertise and return strategic recommendations.

## 4. Managing Context for Long Workflows

When working on complex projects over multiple days, **context** matters. Your conversation history uses working memory—keeping it clean helps decopilot stay focused and productive.

### The 40/80 Rule

- **Below 40%** - Plenty of room, work freely
- **40-80%** - Context filling up, consider compacting
- **Above 80%** - Automatic compactification triggers

### When to Compact

Use the `/compact` command to summarize your conversation before:
- Starting a major new project phase
- Beginning complex multi-step work
- Switching between different focus areas

### Example: Product Launch Preparation

```
Day 1:
You → "Let's plan the Spring Collection launch"
     ↓
[Discussion of strategy, timeline, SKUs...]
     ↓
Context: 25% full
     ↓
     ↓
Day 2:
You → "Run /compact"
     ↓
Decopilot summarizes previous work
     ↓
Context: 15% full (compacted)
     ↓
You → "Now create launch announcement content"
     ↓
[Fresh context for new phase...]
```

### Using Subtasks to Manage Context

Remember: Subtasks keep your main conversation lean. When you spawn a subtask for analysis, only the summary comes back—not the detailed work.

```
You → "Run subtask: audit product data quality
       across entire catalog"
     ↓
Subtask analyzes 1,200 products
(generates 15,000 tokens of detailed findings)
     ↓
You ← "Quality Audit Summary (450 tokens)

       CRITICAL ISSUES: 23 products
       HIGH PRIORITY: 87 products
       MEDIUM PRIORITY: 156 products
       PASSED: 934 products

       [Summary of top issues...]"
```

The subtask used 15,000 tokens of context—but your main conversation only sees 450 tokens. This keeps your working memory focused on what matters.

**Key takeaway:** Use `/compact` before major work phases, and use subtasks to keep detailed work isolated. This maintains conversation quality and productivity.

## 5. Switching Scopes for Different Work

**Scopes** determine what tools and resources are available. Switch scopes based on what you're working on.

### Three Scope Types

**Organization Scope**
- Setting up integrations (Shopify, GitHub, Slack)
- Managing team access and permissions
- Organization-wide configurations

**Project Scope**
- Day-to-day feature work
- Product management
- Content updates and campaigns

**Agent Scope**
- Specialized tasks with focused tools
- Domain expertise (inventory, shipping, etc.)
- Isolated analysis work

### How to Switch Scopes

Use the **agent selector** at the bottom-left of the chat:
- No agent selected = Organization or Project scope (depends on current view)
- Agent selected = Agent scope

### Example: Multi-Scope Workflow

```
Organization Scope (no agent):
You → "Connect our Shopify store to decopilot"
     ↓
Decopilot searches for connection tools
     ↓
Decopilot enables OAuth tools
     ↓
Decopilot guides through OAuth setup
     ↓
You ← "✓ Shopify connected successfully
       Store: mystore.myshopify.com
       Products: 1,247 available"
     ↓
     ↓
Switch to Project Scope (navigate to project):
You → "Update all summer products with new descriptions"
     ↓
Decopilot searches project-specific tools
     ↓
Decopilot enables product management tools
     ↓
Decopilot updates products
     ↓
You ← "✓ Updated 24 products in Summer 2026 collection"
     ↓
     ↓
Switch to Agent Scope (select Inventory Specialist):
You → "Analyze demand for these summer products"
     ↓
Agent searches specialized inventory tools
     ↓
Agent enables forecasting tools
     ↓
Agent analyzes demand
     ↓
You ← "Demand Forecast: [specialist analysis...]"
```

**Key takeaway:** Switch scopes based on your task. Organization for setup, project for daily work, agents for specialized analysis.
