  This page documents the **planned architecture** for decopilot scopes. The implementation is in development.
</Callout>

## What is Scope?

**Scope** is decopilot's current working context—it determines what instructions, tools, and resources are available as you work.

Scope links your current task context with an MCP (Model Context Protocol server) where tools, resources, and prompts are pulled from. Decopilot automatically adapts based on which view you're in, shifting between organization and project contexts.

## Three Scope Types

**Organization Scope**: Work on organization-wide infrastructure, connections, and team management.

**Project Scope**: Day-to-day development work with project-specific tools and resources.

**Agent Scope**: Focused, specialized tasks with bounded capabilities (security reviews, code analysis, testing).

## How Scope is Determined

Scope is determined by **two simple factors**:

1. **Which view you're in**: Organization view or project view
2. **Agent selection**: Whether you have an agent selected in the bottom-left of the chat

**When viewing organization**:
- No agent selected → **Organization scope**
- Agent selected → **Agent scope**

**When viewing a project**:
- No agent selected → **Project scope**
- Agent selected → **Agent scope**

Each scope is completely isolated—there's no inheritance between scopes. When you select an agent, you only have access to that agent's specific tools and resources.

## Scope and Subtasks

[Subtasks](/en/mcp-mesh/decopilot/tasks-and-spawning) can run in different scopes than your main task—this enables agent collaboration.

**Example**: While working in project scope on order fulfillment, you can spawn multiple agents:
- **Inventory Agent** - Assesses stock availability
- **Shipping Agent** - Plans logistics
- **Customer Service Agent** - Prepares support strategy

Your main task coordinates the strategy while each agent handles specialized work in isolation.

<Callout type="tip">
Start in project scope for most work. Switch to agents when you need specialized capabilities or parallel execution.
</Callout>

## Switching Scopes

Use the agent selector at the bottom-left of the chat to switch between scopes:

**Example workflow**:
```
Project (no agent) → implementing features
  ↓
Select security agent → agent scope for security review
  ↓
Deselect agent → back to project scope
```

When you switch, decopilot automatically adjusts available tools and context.

## Key Takeaways

- **Scope adjusts automatically** based on which view you're in and whether an agent is selected
- **Three scope types** provide different capabilities: organization, project, and agent
- **Each scope is isolated** with its own tools and resources
- **Agents are focused** on specialized tasks to maintain clarity

Understanding scope helps you work effectively with decopilot—you'll know what's available and how to organize your work.
