## What is a connection?

A **Connection** in the Mesh is a configured upstream MCP endpoint (typically HTTP). The Mesh stores its configuration and (optionally) credentials, and can then proxy MCP requests to it.

## In the UI

Go to **Connections** to:

- browse connected connections
- create a new connection (**Create Connection**)
- search and manage existing connections

## Proxying to a single connection

Once you have a connection ID, clients can call tools via:

- `POST /mcp/:connectionId`

The Mesh will:

1. authenticate the caller
2. authorize the tool call
3. decrypt credentials (if needed)
4. forward the MCP request to the upstream server
5. log a monitoring event

<Callout type="info">
  If you need a single aggregated endpoint for multiple connections, use [Assistants](/en/mcp-mesh/mcp-gateways) instead.
</Callout>
