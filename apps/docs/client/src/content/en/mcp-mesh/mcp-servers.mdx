## What is a connection?

An **MCP Server** in the Mesh is a configured upstream MCP endpoint (typically HTTP). The Mesh stores its configuration and (optionally) credentials, and can then proxy MCP requests to it.

## In the UI

Go to **MCP Servers** to:

- browse connected servers
- add a new server (**Connect MCP Server**)
- search and manage existing connections

## Proxying to a single connection

Once you have a connection ID, clients can call tools via:

- `POST /mcp/:connectionId`

The Mesh will:

1. authenticate the caller
2. authorize the tool call
3. decrypt credentials (if needed)
4. forward the MCP request to the upstream server
5. log a monitoring event

<Callout type="info">
  If you need a single aggregated endpoint for multiple servers, use [MCP Gateways](/en/mcp-mesh/mcp-gateways) instead.
</Callout>
