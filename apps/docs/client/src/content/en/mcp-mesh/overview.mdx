## What is the MCP Mesh?

The **MCP Mesh** is a **control plane for MCP traffic**. It sits between MCP clients (Cursor, Claude Desktop, custom agents) and MCP servers, providing a centralized layer for **authentication, authorization, credential management, and observability**.

## The problem

When MCP moves from a few PoCs to production usage, teams start paying an “integration tax”:

- **Connection sprawl**: every client wires and maintains its own MCP connections and auth
- **Inconsistent policy enforcement**: SSO/RBAC and approvals drift across apps and teams
- **Operational blind spots**: no unified logs/traces to debug failures end-to-end
- **Tool surface explosion**: too many tools increases context size, latency, and tool-selection errors

The Mesh centralizes these concerns once, so you can operate MCP traffic like any other production surface.

## High-level architecture

```
┌───────────────────┐   ┌──────────────────┐   ┌────────────────────┐
│ MCP Clients       │   │ MCP Mesh (Proxy) │   │ Downstream MCPs     │
│ - Cursor          │──▶│ - AuthN/AuthZ    │──▶│ - Slack / Gmail     │
│ - Claude Desktop  │   │ - Vault          │   │ - Notion / Stripe   │
│ - Custom agents   │   │ - Gateways       │   │ - Your MCP servers  │
└───────────────────┘   │ - Monitoring     │   └────────────────────┘
                        └──────────────────┘
```

## What the Mesh centralizes

- **Routing + execution**: which MCP to call and how to authenticate it
- **Policy enforcement**: who can access which tools (and through which gateways)
- **Observability**: logs, latency, errors, and request context across tool calls
- **Runtime strategies (gateways)**: different exposure strategies as tool surfaces grow

## Product surfaces (what you can do today)

- **Store**: browse a catalog of MCP servers you can connect to (default: the official MCP Registry).
- **MCP Servers**: connect and manage MCP servers (HTTP MCP endpoints).
- **MCP Gateways**: publish a curated “virtual MCP server” that aggregates tools/resources/prompts from multiple connections.
- **API Keys**: create scoped keys with explicit tool permissions.
- **Members & Roles**: invite teammates and manage roles + permissions.
- **Monitoring**: tool-call logs, errors, latency, filtering, and streaming.
- **Deploy**: self-host locally (npx / Docker Compose) or on Kubernetes (Helm).

<Callout type="info">
  We’re releasing the MCP Mesh to the open-source community in **December 2025**.
  It’s new, so these docs reflect what exists **in production today** — but we ship new features every week and will keep updating this documentation as those features land.
