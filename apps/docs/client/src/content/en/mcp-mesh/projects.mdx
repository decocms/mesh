  This page documents the **planned architecture** for projects in MCP Mesh. The implementation is in development.

## What are Projects?

**Projects** are organizational units that **are virtual MCPs themselves**. Unlike traditional project management systems where projects are mere containers, in MCP Mesh a project is a fully-functional virtual MCP server with its own tools, resources, and configuration.

Projects enable teams to:

- **Organize work** by product, client, or initiative
- **Scope capabilities** to specific contexts
- **Configure connections** at both project and organization levels
- **Operate within boundaries** that match your organizational structure

Each project is accessible at `/:org/projects/:project_id` and operates as a self-contained virtual MCP.

## Projects as Virtual MCPs

Projects are virtual MCPs at the organization level—they are the primary organizational container for work. Each project has:

- **Tools**: Project-specific tools or aggregated from connected MCPs
- **Resources**: Documentation, guidelines, context files
- **Prompts**: Custom templates for common workflows

Projects can connect to other virtual MCPs (including agents), compose capabilities from multiple sources, and define inline tools—just like any [Virtual MCP](/en/mcp-mesh/virtual-mcps). The key distinction: projects ARE virtual MCPs themselves, and they can aggregate capabilities from other virtual MCPs within their scope.

```typescript
// Example: Project as virtual MCP
{
  "projectId": "mobile-app-rewrite",
  "name": "Mobile App Rewrite",
  "connections": [
    {
      "connectionId": "github-conn-123",
      "tools": ["CREATE_PR", "LIST_ISSUES", "CREATE_BRANCH"]
    },
    {
      "connectionId": "figma-conn-456",
      "tools": ["GET_DESIGN", "EXPORT_ASSETS"]
    }
  ],
  "prompts": [
    {
      "name": "mobile-pr-template",
      "description": "PR template for mobile features",
      "template": "## Mobile Feature PR\n\n### Changes\n{{changes}}\n\n### Testing\n- [ ] iOS tested\n- [ ] Android tested"
    }
  ],
  "resources": [
    {
      "uri": "project://mobile-app-rewrite/guidelines",
      "name": "Mobile Development Guidelines",
      "mimeType": "text/markdown",
      "content": "# Mobile Guidelines\n\n- Always test on both platforms..."
    }
  ]
}
```

## Configuration Hierarchy

MCP Mesh supports **two levels of configuration**:

**Project-level** (`/:org/projects/:project_id`):
- Project-specific tools and resources
- Project's `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md`
- Connections configured for this project

**Organization-level** (`/:org`):
- Organization-wide tools available across all projects
- Shared resources and prompts
- Organization `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md`

This mirrors Claude Code's familiar pattern: **`.claude/`** (project) and **`~/.claude/`** (global).

## Project Scope and Routing

The route determines the operational scope. When connecting to:

```
/:org/projects/:project_id
```

MCP clients operate within that project's virtual MCP boundary, accessing:

- Project's own resources, tools, and prompts
- Connections dynamically wired to the project
- Project-specific context from `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md`

<Callout type="info">
  Scope isolation ensures that project A cannot access project B's tools or credentials, while still allowing shared organization-level capabilities.
</Callout>

## CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md Support

Both levels support configuration files loaded into context:

**CLAUDE.md**: Provides contextual instructions for AI agents
- **Project-level**: Project-specific coding standards, domain knowledge, workflows
- **Organization-level**: Company-wide guidelines, security policies, best practices

**AGENTS.md**: Defines specialized capabilities via MCP server instructions
- **Project-level**: Project-specific agent configurations
- **Organization-level**: Cross-project agent configurations

## MCP Clients in Project Scope

When MCP clients connect to a project, they become scope-aware:

```typescript
// MCP client operation in project scope
{
  "scope": "/:org/projects/mobile-app-rewrite",
  "availableTools": [
    "CREATE_PR",             // from GitHub connection
    "GET_DESIGN",            // from Figma connection
    "RUN_MOBILE_TESTS"       // project-specific tool
  ],
  "availableResources": [
    "project://mobile-app-rewrite/guidelines"
  ]
}
```

AI agents can use any organization-level or project-specific capabilities to accomplish tasks, always operating within the project's boundary.

## Example: E-commerce Redesign Project

```typescript
{
  "projectId": "ecommerce-redesign",
  "name": "E-commerce Platform Redesign",
  "connections": [
    {
      "connectionId": "shopify-conn-789",
      "tools": ["GET_PRODUCTS", "UPDATE_THEME", "DEPLOY_STOREFRONT"]
    },
    {
      "connectionId": "analytics-conn-101",
      "tools": ["GET_CONVERSION_RATE", "GET_USER_FLOW"]
    }
  ],
  "resources": [
    {
      "uri": "project://ecommerce-redesign/brand-guidelines",
      "name": "Brand Guidelines",
      "mimeType": "text/markdown"
    }
  ]
}
```

AI agents can deploy storefronts, analyze conversion metrics, and reference brand guidelines—all within the project's scope.

## Use Cases

- **Client Projects**: Agencies can create one project per client, each with client-specific tools and credentials
- **Product Lines**: Separate projects for web, mobile, and backend with different toolsets
- **Feature Development**: Temporary projects for major features, with curated tools for that work
- **Multi-tenant SaaS**: Projects as tenant boundaries with isolated capabilities

## Benefits

Projects as virtual MCPs provide:

- **Clear boundaries**: Scope isolation prevents cross-contamination
- **Flexible configuration**: Two-level hierarchy matches organizational structure
- **Dynamic capabilities**: Add or remove tools without infrastructure changes
- **Familiar patterns**: Mirrors `.claude/` local and `~/.claude/` global convention
