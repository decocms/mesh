## What are Projects?

**Projects** are organizational units that leverage [Virtual MCPs](/en/mcp-mesh/virtual-mcps) to manage tools, resources, and prompts within a specific work context. Use projects to isolate capabilities by product, client, team, or initiative.

Projects provide:

- **Work organization** - Group capabilities by product line, client, or feature initiative
- **Scope isolation** - Each project operates with its own set of tools and credentials
- **Contextual configuration** - Project-specific guidelines, documentation, and workflows
- **Team boundaries** - Match your organizational structure with technical boundaries

Projects are available in the sidebar under the **Projects** section, where each operates as a self-contained workspace.

## How Projects Work

Create a project, then configure it by remixing capabilities:

1. **Name** - Identifies the project (e.g., "Mobile App Rewrite", "Client XYZ Portal")
2. **Description** - Explains the project's purpose, scope, and goals for your team
3. **Instructions** - Guidelines for how AI agents should work in this project (like `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md`)
4. **Tools** - Actions agents may take on this project (select from [connections](/en/mcp-mesh/connections) or create inline)
5. **Resources** - Extra info for detailed skills the agent may need (documentation, guidelines, domain knowledge)
6. **Prompts** - How users are supposed to use this project (detailed workflows that combine tools and resources to accomplish specific goals)

Since projects are [Virtual MCPs](/en/mcp-mesh/virtual-mcps), you get full composability—remix external capabilities with custom definitions to build exactly what your team needs.

## Example: E-commerce Project

An e-commerce redesign project might aggregate Shopify tools for storefront management, analytics tools for conversion tracking, and brand guidelines as resources. AI agents working in this project deploy storefronts, analyze metrics, and follow brand standards—all within the project's isolated scope.

## Scope Isolation

Projects enforce boundaries through routing. When AI agents connect to a project, they:

- Access only tools configured for that project
- See project-specific resources and guidelines
- Operate within isolated credentials and permissions

Project A cannot access Project B's tools or credentials. Organization-level capabilities remain available across all projects.

## Use Cases

- **Client work** - One project per client with isolated tools and credentials
- **Product lines** - Separate mobile, web, and backend projects with distinct toolsets
- **Feature initiatives** - Temporary projects for major features with curated capabilities
- **Multi-tenancy** - Projects as tenant boundaries in SaaS applications

## Why Use Projects?

- **Clear boundaries** - Prevent tool and credential cross-contamination between initiatives
- **Organized work** - Match technical scope to organizational structure
- **Flexible tooling** - Add or remove capabilities without infrastructure changes
- **Familiar patterns** - `.claude/` (project) and `~/.claude/` (global) convention
