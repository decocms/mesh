## Get Started in 5 Minutes

The fastest way to experience deco CMS is through our managed service at **mesh-admin.decocms.com**. You'll be up and running with your first MCP connection in minutes.

### Step 1: Sign Up

Navigate to [mesh-admin.decocms.com](https://mesh-admin.decocms.com) and create your account using:
- Email and password
- GitHub OAuth
- Google OAuth

### Step 2: Create Your First Organization

After signing in, you'll be prompted to create an organization. This is your top-level tenant boundary where you'll manage connections, agents, and team members.

Choose an organization name (e.g., "Acme Store" or "My Ecommerce Business") and click **Create Organization**.

### Step 3: Add a Connection from the Store

Connections are MCP servers you want to use. deco CMS comes with a built-in store of popular integrations:

1. Navigate to **Connections** in the sidebar
2. Click **Add from Store**
3. Browse available connections (Shopify, Stripe, WooCommerce, BigCommerce, etc.)
4. Select a connection and click **Install**
5. Provide required credentials:
   - For OAuth connections: Follow the OAuth flow to authorize
   - For API key connections: Paste your API key

Your connection is now registered and credentials are encrypted in deco CMS's vault.

### Step 4: Start Using Chat

Once you've connected at least one MCP server, you can start using the built-in chat interface:

1. Navigate to **Chat** in the sidebar
2. Your connected tools are automatically available to the AI assistant
3. Try asking questions or requesting actions that use your connections:
   - "Show me today's orders from Shopify"
   - "What's my current inventory for product SKU-12345?"
   - "List recent failed payment transactions from Stripe"
   - "Create a refund for order #1234"
   - "Update the stock quantity for product 'Wireless Headphones' to 150 units"
   - "Generate a sales report for the last 30 days"
   - "Send abandoned cart reminders to customers from last week"

The AI will automatically invoke the right tools from your connections to fulfill your requests.
