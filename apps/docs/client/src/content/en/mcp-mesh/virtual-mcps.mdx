## What Are Virtual MCPs?

In deco CMS, a **Virtual MCP** is a reusable package of capabilities—[tools, resources, and prompts](/en/mcp-mesh/concepts#mcp-protocol-primitives)—remixed from multiple [connections](/en/mcp-mesh/connections).

Instead of giving your AI agent access to everything from every connection, you **compose virtual MCPs** that expose exactly what's needed for each use case. You can:

- **Remix connections**: Select specific tools and context from each connection
- **Combine multiple sources**: Package GitHub + Slack + databases into one unified MCP
- **Add custom logic**: Extend with inline tools, prompts, and resources
- **Update dynamically**: Change what's included without reconfiguring your agents

Virtual MCPs are the **backbone of deco CMS**—powering [Projects](/en/mcp-mesh/projects), [Agents](/en/mcp-mesh/agents), and organizational boundaries for how capabilities are packaged and composed.

## How Virtual MCPs Work

Virtual MCPs are built by **remixing connections**—selecting capabilities from external MCPs—and optionally **extending with custom tools, prompts, and resources**.

### Remix from Connections

**Remixing** lets you select and combine tools, resources, and prompts from multiple [connections](/en/mcp-mesh/connections).

A **connection** is how you wire up an external MCP server to deco CMS (see [Connections](/en/mcp-mesh/connections) for details). Once you have connections set up, remixing works like this:

1. **Select specific capabilities** from each connection—tools, resources, prompts
2. **Combine them** into a single virtual MCP package
3. **Your agent gets** aggregated access to all selected capabilities in one place

**Example**: A "deployment-ops" virtual MCP might remix:
- **GitHub connection**: PR management tools + repository documentation
- **Slack connection**: Messaging and notification tools
- **Database connection**: Migration and schema tools

Your AI agent uses this one virtual MCP to orchestrate across all three systems.

### Extend with Inline Capabilities

**Inline creation** lets you define tools, resources, and prompts directly within a virtual MCP—extending what connections provide.

Inline tools can **call any MCP connection** available in your deco CMS instance, enabling powerful patterns like orchestration, validation, and feature gating.

Inline tools can call other tools using `callTool(connectionId:TOOL_NAME, params)`, enabling orchestration, validation, and feature gating across your MCP infrastructure.

This remixing approach is perfect for:

- **Custom prompts** that guide agents through team-specific workflows
- **Context resources** like guidelines, documentation, or domain knowledge
- **Orchestration tools** that compose tools from multiple connections into higher-level operations
- **Feature gating and validation** that wrap connection tools with authorization logic (see [Authorization and Roles](/en/mcp-mesh/user-management))

#### Use Case: Feature Gating

Inline tools are ideal for **feature gating**—wrapping connection tools with validation, authorization, or custom behavior.

**Example**: A read-only database tool that validates queries before calling the underlying connection, blocking dangerous operations like `DROP`, `DELETE`, or `UPDATE`.

#### Use Case: Orchestration

Inline tools can coordinate multiple connections in a single operation.

**Example**: A deployment tool that runs tests (CI connection), merges a PR (GitHub connection), and notifies the team (Slack connection)—all in one coordinated workflow.

These patterns enable **authorization enforcement**, **input validation**, **audit logging** (see [Monitoring](/en/mcp-mesh/monitoring)), and **workflow orchestration** across your MCP infrastructure.

### Combine Both

The real power comes from combining both approaches—remixing capabilities from connections and extending them with inline definitions.

**Example**: A "development-assistant" virtual MCP that combines:
- **GitHub connection tools**: PR management, issue tracking
- **GitHub connection resources**: Repository contributing guide
- **Inline prompts**: Custom PR description templates for your team
- **Inline resources**: Team coding standards and style guides

One virtual MCP, multiple sources (connections + inline definitions), unified agent experience.

## Namespacing & Collision Avoidance

When aggregating capabilities from multiple connections, deco CMS uses **connection-based namespacing** to avoid collisions. Each connection gets a unique ID, and all capabilities from that connection are prefixed with this ID.

### Tools and Prompts

Tools and prompts use the format: `connection_id::CAPABILITY_NAME`

- **Namespace separator**: `::` (double colon) between connection ID and capability name
- **64-character limit**: The entire namespaced name cannot exceed 64 characters

**Example**: Two GitHub connections can both expose a `CREATE_PR` tool:
- `github_personal_456::CREATE_PR` (personal account)
- `github_work_789::CREATE_PR` (work account)

This ensures capabilities remain distinct even when multiple connections expose tools with the same name.

### Resources

Resources use URI-based namespacing, **except for well-known protocols**.

**Custom protocols** (like `repo://`, `team://`) get namespaced with the connection ID and URL-encoded:
- Original: `repo://my-org/my-repo/README.md`
- Namespaced: `github_conn_123://repo%3A%2F%2Fmy-org%2Fmy-repo%2FREADME.md`

**Well-known protocols** (like `http://`, `https://`, `ws://`) are **NOT namespaced** and remain unchanged.

**Automatic content rewriting**: When resources are read through a virtual MCP, deco CMS automatically rewrites internal resource links to use the namespaced format. This ensures resources can reference each other correctly.

Tools and prompts use `connection_id::CAPABILITY_NAME` format (max 64 chars). Resources use `connection_id://encodedUri` for custom protocols, or stay unchanged for well-known protocols.

## Features Powered by Virtual MCPs

Virtual MCPs provide the **foundational capability** that powers specialized features across deco CMS. All of these inherit full [monitoring capabilities](/en/mcp-mesh/monitoring) for audit trails and observability.

**MCP Client Compatibility**: Virtual MCPs are callable by any MCP-compatible client—including Cursor, Claude Code, VS Code extensions, and any application that implements the Model Context Protocol. This makes your composed capability packages universally accessible across the AI tooling ecosystem.

**Specialized features built on virtual MCPs:**

- **[Agents](/en/mcp-mesh/agents)**: Single-purpose capability packages optimized for specific tasks
- **[Projects](/en/mcp-mesh/projects)**: Team-scoped capability packages for organizational boundaries

## Use Cases & Benefits

Virtual MCPs turn fragmented MCP connections into unified, reusable capability packages:

**Real-world applications:**
- **Unified Deployment Ops**: Package GitHub (PRs, releases) + Slack (notifications) + database (migrations) into one deployment MCP
- **Custom Code Review**: Remix GitHub tools with inline security/performance prompts and team style guides
- **Development Assistant**: Combine GitHub + Jira tools with inline workflow prompts and project context
- **Team-wide MCP Sharing**: Share access to a Cloudflare MCP connection across your team while filtering out administrative operations—giving developers safe, scoped access to DNS management and Workers deployment without exposing account-level controls
- **Cross-system Orchestration**: Package CRM, analytics, and communication tools for end-to-end business processes

**Key benefits:**
- **Selective remixing**: Choose exactly which tools, resources, and prompts to include from each connection
- **Inline extensions**: Add custom orchestration, validation, and feature gating logic
- **Dynamic updates**: Modify what's included without reconfiguring agents
- **Foundation for specialization**: Building block for [Projects](/en/mcp-mesh/projects) and [Agents](/en/mcp-mesh/agents)
