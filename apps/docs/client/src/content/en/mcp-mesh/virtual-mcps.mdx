## MCP Compliance & Benefits

decocms is fully **MCP compliant**, following the Model Context Protocol specification. MCPs let AI agents work beyond your computer—acting on databases, APIs, SaaS tools, and production systems. MCP is a **protocol for action**, enabling agents to read, write, and orchestrate across your infrastructure.

## The Challenge

Creating traditional MCP servers requires writing server code, managing infrastructure, and maintaining updates—a barrier that prevents many teams from leveraging MCP's full potential.

## Virtual MCPs: The Solution

**Virtual MCPs** are decocms's answer to this challenge. They let you **create MCP servers on the spot**, without writing server code or managing infrastructure.

A Virtual MCP is a **virtual MCP server** that aggregates tools, resources, and prompts into a single MCP-compliant endpoint. Instead of writing and deploying server code, you configure what capabilities to expose—and decocms handles the rest.

Virtual MCPs are:

- **Dynamically created**: spin up new MCPs through configuration, not code
- **Production-ready**: fully MCP-compliant endpoints that work with any MCP client
- **Instantly updated**: attach new tools or resources without redeploying servers
- **Foundation for advanced features**: the building block for agents and organizational tooling

## How Virtual MCPs Work

Virtual MCPs can be created in two fundamental ways, and you can mix both approaches as needed.

### Approach 1: Composition (Mix Existing Connections)

**Composition** lets you aggregate capabilities from multiple connected MCP servers into a unified virtual MCP.

Here's how it works:

1. **Connect MCP servers** to your decocms instance (GitHub, Slack, databases, etc.)
2. **Select tools** from one or more connections you want to expose
3. **Configure the virtual MCP** to include these selected capabilities
4. **Get a single endpoint** that exposes the aggregated toolset

**Example**: Create a "deployment" virtual MCP that combines:
- GitHub tools (create PRs, merge, tag releases)
- Slack tools (post updates, create threads)
- Database tools (run migrations, verify schema)

Your AI agent connects to one virtual MCP endpoint and gets access to all three systems.

```typescript
// Configuration example: composition approach
{
  "name": "deployment-virtual-mcp",
  "mode": "include",
  "connections": [
    {
      "connectionId": "github-conn-123",
      "tools": ["CREATE_PR", "MERGE_PR", "CREATE_TAG"]
    },
    {
      "connectionId": "slack-conn-456",
      "tools": ["POST_MESSAGE", "CREATE_THREAD"]
    },
    {
      "connectionId": "database-conn-789",
      "tools": ["RUN_MIGRATION", "VERIFY_SCHEMA"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Approach 2: Inline Creation

**Inline creation** lets you create resources, prompts, and tools directly within decocms—no external MCP server needed.

This is perfect for:

- **Custom prompts** tailored to your team's workflows
- **Resources** like documentation, guidelines, or context
- **Tools** that orchestrate other tools or implement custom logic

**Example**: Create a virtual MCP with inline prompts for code review:

```typescript
// Configuration example: inline approach
{
  "name": "code-review-virtual-mcp",
  "prompts": [
    {
      "name": "security-review",
      "description": "Review code for security vulnerabilities",
      "template": "Analyze this code for security issues:\n- SQL injection\n- XSS vulnerabilities\n- Auth bypasses\n\nCode:\n{{code}}"
    },
    {
      "name": "performance-review",
      "description": "Review code for performance issues",
      "template": "Analyze this code for performance problems:\n- N+1 queries\n- Memory leaks\n- Inefficient algorithms\n\nCode:\n{{code}}"
    }
  ],
  "resources": [
    {
      "uri": "review://guidelines",
      "name": "Code Review Guidelines",
      "mimeType": "text/markdown",
      "content": "# Review Guidelines\n\n1. Security first\n2. Performance matters\n..."
    }
  ]
}
```

### Hybrid: Mix Both Approaches

Combine composition and inline creation in the same virtual MCP:

```typescript
// Hybrid example: external tools + inline prompts
{
  "name": "development-assistant",
  "connections": [
    {
      "connectionId": "github-conn-123",
      "tools": ["CREATE_PR", "LIST_ISSUES"]
    }
  ],
  "prompts": [
    {
      "name": "pr-template",
      "description": "Generate PR description from commits",
      "template": "Create a PR description from these commits:\n{{commits}}"
    }
  ]
}
```

This virtual MCP exposes GitHub tools from an external connection alongside custom prompts defined inline.

## Virtual MCP Configuration

Virtual MCPs are dynamically configurable:

- **Tool selection**: Specify which tools to include from each connection
- **Dynamic updates**: attach new tools, resources, or prompts
- **Endpoint**: Each virtual MCP gets a unique endpoint at `/mcp/virtual/:virtualId`

Every organization gets a **default virtual MCP** that aggregates all connections.

## Concepts Built on Virtual MCPs

Virtual MCPs are the **foundational feature** for specialized capabilities:

- **Agents**: Single-purpose virtual MCPs optimized for specific tasks (see [Concepts](/en/mcp-mesh/concepts))
- **Organization MCP**: Default virtual MCP that aggregates all your connections

## Use Cases

- **Unified Deployment**: Mix GitHub, Slack, and database MCPs into one endpoint for CI/CD workflows
- **Custom Code Review**: Define inline prompts tailored to your team's review process
- **Hybrid Development Assistant**: Combine external tools (GitHub, Jira) with inline prompts for contextual guidance

## Benefits Summary

Virtual MCPs eliminate infrastructure barriers:

- **No server code or infrastructure**: configure capabilities, decocms handles hosting
- **Dynamic updates**: modify tools and resources without downtime
- **Composition and inline creation**: aggregate existing MCPs or define custom logic
- **Foundation for advanced workflows**: building block for agents and organizational tooling

Virtual MCPs make MCP accessible to every team—no DevOps required.
