## What is MCP Studio?

**MCP Studio** is the development layer of deco CMS: a **no-code admin + SDK** to package MCP-native capabilities into durable, reusable building blocks.

Learn more: [MCP Studio product page](https://www.decocms.com/mcp-studio)

Use it to turn **tools + schemas + workflows** into apps with:

- Consistent interfaces
- Explicit permissions and policies
- Versioning and curation
- A safe path for other teams to adopt what works

<Callout type="info">
  **Coming soon:** MCP Studio is being built on top of **the MCP Mesh** and will replace the legacy SaaS admin (`admin.decocms.com`) over time (including a hosted option by us).
</Callout>

## Where does it fit?

- **The MCP Mesh (foundation):** connect, govern, and observe MCP traffic
- **MCP Studio (development):** package and curate reusable capabilities
- **MCP Apps & Store (distribution):** distribute what works across teams
