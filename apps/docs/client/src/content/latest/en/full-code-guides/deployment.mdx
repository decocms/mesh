## Deploy Command

When you're ready to share your app with the world (or your team), you'll deploy it to Cloudflare Workers via the deco CLI.


```bash
npm run deploy
```

That's it! Your app goes live on Cloudflare's global edge network.

## What Happens

**1. Build frontend**
- Vite bundles React app (`/view`) into optimized static files
- Output goes to `/view/dist`

**2. Build worker**
- TypeScript compiles `server/main.ts`
- Dependencies bundled
- Static assets attached using Workers asset binding

**3. Upload to Cloudflare**
- Uses `wrangler.toml` for project configuration
- Worker code deployed globally
- Assets served from edge
- Database (D1) provisioned automatically

**4. Live URL**
- Your app goes live at `https://<app-name>.deco.page`
- MCP endpoint available at `https://<app-name>.deco.page/mcp`

<Callout type="success">
  **One repo, one deploy, one URL.** Frontend, backend, and database deploy together with shared context and zero integration code.
</Callout>

## Authentication

First deploy requires authentication:

```bash
deco login
# or
npx deco-cli login
```

Opens browser to authenticate. Your credentials persist locally.

## CI/CD Deployment

For automated deployments, use an API token:

```bash
deco deploy -t <your-api-token>
```

Get tokens from your workspace settings with `HOSTING_APP_DEPLOY` permission.

**GitHub Actions example:**
```yaml
name: Deploy
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
    
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '22'
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm run deploy
        env:
          DECO_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.DECO_TOKEN }}
```

## Edge Runtime Benefits

**Global deployment:**
Code runs in 300+ cities worldwide. Users connect to the nearest edge location.

**Auto-scaling:**
Cloudflare handles traffic spikes automatically. No capacity planning needed.

**Zero cold starts:**
Workers stay warm. First request is as fast as the hundredth.

**Efficient I/O:**
Worker suspends during `await` calls (fetch, database queries). External API waits don't count against CPU time, keeping costs low even with heavy external dependencies.

## Post-Deploy Testing

Test production immediately after deploy:

1. Open `https://<app-name>.deco.page`
2. Verify frontend loads correctly
3. Test tool calls through UI
4. Check integrations work (production may use different credentials than dev)
5. Test as an end user would interact with the app
6. Review Cloudflare Worker logs if issues occur

## Updates and Rollbacks

**Deploy updates:**
```bash
# Make changes
npm run deploy
```

Fast deployments mean you can iterate quickly.

**Rollback:**
```bash
git checkout <previous-commit>
npm run deploy
```

No built-in version management yet. Use Git to track changes and redeploy previous versions if needed.

<Callout type="warning">
  **Environment variables:** Set production secrets in `wrangler.toml` or Cloudflare dashboard. Never commit secrets to Git.
</Callout>

## Custom Domains

Custom domain support coming soon. For now, apps deploy to `*.deco.page` subdomains.

**Remember:** Every deploy is a fresh start. Database persists, but Worker code updates instantly across all edge locations.
