## Build Your First AI App

Create an app that writes poems, saves them, and emails them to your team.

<StepGroup>
  <Step number={1} title="Explore the App Store">
    1. Log in to [admin.decocms.com](https://admin.decocms.com)
    2. Navigate to your organization and project
    3. Click **Apps** in the sidebar
    4. Browse available integrations or open "Store" to install new ones
    5. Select the Gmail app from the store
    6. Connect the app and authorize your account  
    
    <Callout type="info">
      Apps are pre-built integrations that expose tools. They serve as building blocks for your AI applications.
    </Callout>
 
 </Step>

  <Step number={2} title="Test integration in the chat interface">
    Open **New Thread** from the sidebar and ask deco chat:
    
    ```
    Create a poem about deco CMS, save it to a document and email it to you@yourcompany.com using @SEND_EMAIL
    ```
    
    Watch deco chat:
    - Create the poem
    - Call `DECO_RESOURCE_DOCUMENT_CREATE` to save it
    - Call `SEND_EMAIL` from Gmail integration to send it
    
    <Callout type="tip">
      Use **@ mentions** to call specific tools and resources.
    </Callout>
  </Step>

  <Step number={3} title="Make it reusable">
    Turn this one-off task into reusable automation:
    
    ### Create an Agent
    
    Go to **Agents** → **New Agent**:
    - Assign tools for document creation using `@DECO_RESOURCE_DOCUMENT_CREATE` and email sending using `@SEND_EMAIL`
    - Add instructions for your use case and save your agent
    - Now anyone can use it
    
    ### Create a Workflow
    
    Create workflows from:
    - **Workflows** → **New Workflow** and describe what you need in deco chat
    - Use `@workflow_management` in any thread or agent conversation
    
    **Example:**
    ```
    Create a workflow for daily poem generation
    ```
    Then iterate naturally, as you would when assigning the task to someone else
    
    Or, you can be more specific from the get-go:
    ```
    Create a workflow called "poem-mailer" that:
    1. Takes input: topic (string) and recipients (string)
    2. Generates a poem about the topic using AI
    3. Saves to documents with tags ["poem", "ai-generated"]
    4. Emails to recipients every morning at 9am
    ```
    
    ### Create a Custom View
    
    Build interfaces for your data:
    ```
    Create a view called "poem-gallery" that:
    - Shows all poems from documents
    - Displays in 3-column grid
    - Each card shows title, description, creation date
    - Add search bar to filter by name
    - Make it beautiful
    ```
  </Step>
</StepGroup>

## Agent Modes

We are introducing three specialized agent modes for different stages:

- **Explorer** - Discover capabilities and tools
- **Planner** - Design applications and write PRDs
- **Builder** - Implement tools, workflows, and views

Switch modes via the chat interface selector. Each has optimized tool access.
