import Callout from "../../../components/ui/Callout.astro";

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v22+ ([download](https://nodejs.org))
- **Git**
- **Code editor** ([Cursor](https://cursor.com) recommended)
- **TypeScript basics** ([docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/))

## Initial Setup

### Create Your First App

```bash
npm create deco@latest
cd <your-app-name>
npm install
deco login
```

Opens browser for authentication. You can create a new account if you don’t have one.

### Local Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Starts local server on port 8787 with hot reload enabled. The preview URL is accessible anywhere now.

### Project Structure

The server serves both:
- MCP app at `/mcp`
- React frontend view at `/`

### Test Your MCP Server

1. Go to [admin.decocms.com](https://admin.decocms.com)
2. **Add Integration** → **Custom Integration**
3. Paste preview URL + `/mcp`
4. Save and test default tools that come from template

### Deploy

When you are ready to share your MCP:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This builds and deploys your MCP app to Cloudflare Workers, making it available on your organization's private registry.

## Understanding the Current Workflow

As you know by now, there are two ways to build AI apps using deco:
1. **Platform/UI** - Build in [admin.decocms.com](https://admin.decocms.com)
2. **CLI** - Build locally with TypeScript

These workflows exist separately right now and moving between them isn't seamless yet.

### Bridging UI and Code

While we work toward seamless integration, you have two options:

**1. Workspace Resources (deconfig pull/push)**

Work with all resources in a workspace:

```bash
# Pull all resources from entire workspace
deco deconfig pull -w <workspace> --path <path>

# Edit locally in your IDE

# Push changes back to workspace
deco deconfig push -w <workspace> --path <path>
```

**Note:** If you're not inside a deco project folder or haven't initialized the CLI in your editor, you'll need to install it globally using `npm i -g deco-cli@latest` in order to get access to deco commands

**2. Single Project (export/import)**

Work with one specific project within an organization:

```bash
# Export a single project (tools, views, workflows, agents, schemas)
deco project export --org <org> --project <project> --out ./my-project

# Edit locally in your IDE

# Import back to same or different organization
deco project import --from ./my-project --org <org>
```

**Use cases:**
- **Workspace pull/push:** Quick sync of all workspace resources for iteration
- **Project export/import:** Move specific projects between organizations or archive them

<Callout type="info">
  **What we're building toward:** Git-native sync between UI and code.
