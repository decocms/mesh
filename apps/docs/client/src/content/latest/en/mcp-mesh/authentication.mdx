## What’s supported

The Mesh uses Better Auth and supports:

- **Email/password**
- **Magic link**
- **Social providers** (e.g. Google, GitHub)
- **SAML SSO** (for enterprise orgs)

## Configure auth (self-hosting)

Self-hosted deployments load an `auth-config.json` file at startup (see your deployment guides for mounting details).

<Callout type="warning">
  Keep provider secrets out of Git. In production, use Secrets management (Kubernetes Secrets, External Secrets Operator, etc.).
</Callout>

## Key environment variables

- `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` (required)
- `BETTER_AUTH_URL` / `BASE_URL` (recommended to set explicitly in production)
