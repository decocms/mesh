## Core entities

- **Organization**: the top-level tenant boundary. Everything (connections, agents, logs) is org-scoped.
- **Members**: users invited into an organization.
- **Roles**: role assignments for members, used by access control checks.
- **Connection**: a configured upstream MCP endpoint (usually HTTP), optionally with stored credentials.
- **Agent**: a virtual MCP server that aggregates multiple connections into a single MCP surface.
- **Tool call**: a `tools/call` request routed through the Mesh to a downstream MCP server (or via an agent).
- **Monitoring log**: a record of a tool call (inputs, outputs, duration, error), used for debugging and ops.

## Data and security boundaries

- **Credential Vault**: sensitive connection credentials are encrypted at rest (vaulted) and only decrypted at request time.
- **Permissions**: API keys are scoped to tool permissions; the Mesh enforces authorization before proxying.

## How requests flow

1. A client authenticates (OAuth session or API key).
2. The client calls either:
   - the **Management MCP** (admin tools), or
   - a **Proxy endpoint** (one connection), or
   - an **Agent endpoint** (aggregated tools/resources/prompts).
3. The Mesh authorizes, loads credentials, proxies to the downstream Connection(s), and logs monitoring events.
