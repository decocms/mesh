import Callout from "../../../components/ui/Callout.astro";

## Client options

There are two common ways to connect clients to the Mesh:

- **OAuth (recommended for interactive clients)**: supports standard OAuth flows, consent, and organization-aware access.
- **API Keys (recommended for servers/agents)**: scoped keys with explicit tool permissions.

## Endpoints you’ll use

- **Management MCP**: `POST /mcp`
- **Connection proxy**: `POST /mcp/:connectionId`
- **Agent (virtual server)**: `POST /mcp/gateway/:gatewayId` (or omit `:gatewayId` to use the org default Agent with headers)

<Callout type="tip">
  If your goal is a "single MCP URL" for a curated tool surface, use **Agents**. If you want a direct pipe to one upstream MCP, use **Connection proxy**.
</Callout>

## Authentication quick notes

- **OAuth** is ideal when you want per-user identity and browser-based sign-in.
- **API keys** are ideal for automation and server-to-server access (least friction to bootstrap).
