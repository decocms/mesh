## What gets recorded

The Mesh records monitoring logs for proxied tool calls, including:

- tool name
- connection / agent attribution
- user identity (user ID or API key user)
- duration and error status
- inputs and output (normalized)

## In the UI

Go to **Monitoring** to:

- view tool call volume, errors, and latency
- filter by tool/connection/agent/status
- tail logs via **Streaming**
- drill into individual calls

## Why this matters

Monitoring is the backbone for:

- debugging broken tool calls
- verifying permissions and agent selection
- tracking latency regressions and error spikes
