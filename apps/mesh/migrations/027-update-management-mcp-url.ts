/**
 * Update Management MCP Connection URLs and Reset Tools
 *
 * This migration:
 * 1. Updates existing management MCP connections from `/mcp` to `/mcp/management`
 *    to match the new route structure.
 * 2. Resets the `tools` column to NULL so tools are fetched fresh from the
 *    management MCP endpoint (which has the correctly named tools).
 *
 * The management MCP endpoint has been moved from `/mcp` to `/mcp/management`
 * so that `/mcp` can serve the default virtual MCP (Decopilot).
 *
 * Setting tools to NULL causes the proxy to fall back to fetching tools
 * directly from the MCP endpoint, which returns the current ALL_TOOLS
 * with correctly renamed tools (COLLECTION_VIRTUAL_MCP_* instead of COLLECTION_GATEWAY_*).
