/**
 * Update Management MCP Connection URLs from /mcp/management to /mcp/self
 *
 * This migration:
 * 1. Updates existing management MCP connections from `/mcp/management` to `/mcp/self`
 *    to match the new route structure.
 * 2. Resets the `tools` column to NULL so tools are fetched fresh from the
 *    management MCP endpoint.
 *
 * The management MCP endpoint has been moved from `/mcp/management` to `/mcp/self`
 * to better reflect its purpose as the self-management endpoint.
 *
 * Setting tools to NULL causes the proxy to fall back to fetching tools
 * directly from the MCP endpoint, which returns the current ALL_TOOLS.
